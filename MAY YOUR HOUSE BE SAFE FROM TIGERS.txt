MAY YOUR HOUSE BE SAFE FROM TIGERS
Page 1 of 97
Page 2 of 97

The late comedian, Alexander King, had a Buddhist friend who

always said a little prayer when he left King's apartment:

"May your house be safe from tigers."

After three years, King grew tired of the mantra and asked

angrily, "What is the meaning of this idiot prayer?"

"Well," said the friend, "have you been bothered by any tigers

lately?"

WHITE TEXT ON BLACK BG: "You can make sense of this world

only if you base the world on consciousness." - Amit Goswami

As the text fades, we hear the first scream.

FADE IN:

EXT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - MORNING

Chaos. Police cars and fire trucks. Students and teachers run

from the burning building. Black smoke rises into a clear

blue morning sky. A news van pulls up. The NEWS CREW quickly

assembles. A NEWSWOMAN (blonde, 40’s) speaks into the camera:

NEWSWOMAN

I’m here at Barry Goldwater where

gunshots have been reported.

Nothing is confirmed, however a

fire has broken out and the –-

She turns to look at the FIREMEN dousing the school’s roof.

NEWSWOMAN

-- fire department does not yet

have it under control.

MARIA (Hispanic, 16) stumbles by, teary eyed.

NEWSWOMAN

Miss, can you tell me what

happened?

MARIA

He saved me. He saved us.

The girl rushes, sobbing, to a Hispanic woman, MAMA.

MARIA

Mama?

MAMA

Mi bebé! Mi bebé! Me moriría si te

perdiera. Yo no sería nada.

NEWSWOMAN

(back to camera)

We know very little about what

transpired here today, but even as

we piece together the awful events

that caused the chaos you see

behind me, we have to remember

this: In the midst of tragedy,

there were heroes.

INT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ – JAMES FAIRFIELD’S OFFICE - DAY

NOAH EVEMERAS (20’s, blandly attractive and breaking inside)

sits uncomfortably in an office chair. GERRY (30’s, nebbish

HR guy) sits to Noah’s left. Noah’s eyes are red, distant.

JAMES FAIRFIELD (O.S.)

Noah? Does any of this come as a

surprise to you?

Noah doesn’t reply. Fairfield (50’s, graying) sits behind his

desk, framed by windows that look out onto desert mountains.

JAMES FAIRFIELD

Noah?

Noah starts, lost staring into the mountains. His eyes focus.

NOAH

Um? No. No, I guess not.

Noah looks down at his hands. Fairfield opens a folder and, as SOMEONE in the building LAUGHS, averts his gaze into it.

JAMES FAIRFIELD

Well, look, I spoke with Art. He

agreed to give you a severance

package that should keep you afloat

until you find something else. I’ll

be happy to recommend you or, if

the economy picks up, we can

discuss a re-hire.

Noah stands and reaches out to shake Fairfield’s hand.

NOAH

(voice catching)

Thank you for the opportunity.

INT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ - HALLWAY

Noah carries a box while Gerry follows him past a CONFERENCE

ROOM WITH COFFERED CEILINGS where ART, DAVE, and PETE (50’s, fat, in bad suits) laugh loudly again among themselves.

INT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ - LOBBY

Noah and Gerry exit the elevator and pass beneath a LARGE OIL

PAINTING of the company’s president, C. CLARENCE KYLE.

EXT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ - PARKING LOT – CONTINUOUS

The building looms over Noah. He glances back and can just

make out SOMEONE WATCHING HIM from the top floor.

INT. NOAH’S CAR - CIRCLE K LOT - DAY

Noah watches people enter and exit the store. He begins to

hyperventilate, then pounds his fists, screaming at nothing.

He calms himself, reaches into the 30 pack of PBR sitting

next to him, and chugs one quietly. Title:

MAY YOUR HOUSE BE SAFE FROM TIGERS

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLAIRE (20’s, in pajamas) scrubs plates in the sink. Noah

sits on the couch, talking into a cell phone.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

I’ll figure it out. Not yet, no.

His voice rises and he sits up, exasperated.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Because I got fired less than two

hours ago! Why...how could I have my

resume ready???

CLAIRE (O.S.)

You weren’t fired.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

“Laid off.”

Claire comes in, shaking beer cans and picking up empties.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Ok. I will. It’s fine. I still have

coverage until the end of the

month. Look, I have to go. I will! ...Good bye. Love you, too.

He hangs up, pretends to choke the phone.

CLAIRE

(sing song)

And how is your mother?

NOAH

(laughing slightly)

Fine. (MORE)

NOAH (CONT’D)

I’m the handsomest, smartest boy in

the world, so I should be working

again in no time.

Claire sits down next to Noah and puts her arms around him.

CLAIRE

You are the handsomest, smartest

boy in the world.

Noah hugs her back, but dodges the compliment.

NOAH

Ugh, what am I going to do?

CLAIRE

You’ll find something. You hated

that job.

NOAH

I never fit in there, did I? I

just...I want to be able to provide

for us.

CLAIRE

We’ll be frugal. You have some

money saved. You have your

severance.

NOAH

I don’t want it all falling on you.

CLAIRE

We’ll get through this. Have you

talked to your father yet?

NOAH

Not sure I’m ready for that

conversation.

She kisses him and looks him in the eyes.

CLAIRE

I have to get ready for bed. You

coming? Maybe I can help you relax?

NOAH

(not taking the hint)

No, I’m ok. I think I need to burn

this off, just be sad for a little

while.
Page 6 of 97
Page 7 of 97

5.

CLAIRE

Well, you’ll have a lot to talk

about tomorrow at least. Has Dr. Saxon been helping?

Noah hangs his head, fiddles with his drink.

CLAIRE

This isn’t the end of the world.

You just have to take charge of the

situation, put together your

resume. Show them who you are, baby. Show them what you can do.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

ON TV: A campaign commercial for MARCO FLORES. “You can

believe in Flores.”

The house is dark. Noah sits in the exact same spot on the

couch. He drinks the whiskey slurry from the bottom of a

rocks glass, then refills it, while staring at his laptop.

NOAH

(clicking on job websites)

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Two fizzing tablets drop into a water glass. Noah snores,

sprawled on the couch. Claire shakes him gently.

CLAIRE

Hey. Wake up.

He barely opens his eyes. She hands him the glass of water.

CLAIRE

Drink this. Let’s get you into bed.

Noah swills it down. Claire pulls him onto his feet.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Noah follows her into the bedroom and falls face first onto

the mattress. Claire turns him on his back and pulls off his

pants. He is asleep again. Claire spoons into him, worried.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

Noah opens his eyes groggily. Claire is gone.

EXT. NOAH’S HOUSE – DAY

Noah gets in his car, starts the engine, pauses, turns the

engine off, and gets out. On the car, directly in the center, lies A DEAD RAVEN, its body shattered from a great fall.

Noah considers the carcass on his hood, then stares up at the

empty sky. He gets back in his car, pulls out of the

driveway, accelerates, then brakes, sending the dead bird

flying into the street.

INT. NOAH’S CAR - CARWASH - DAY

ON THE RADIO: A discussion of the housing market’s collapse.

Noah sits dead eyed as SOAP SUDS wash over the windows. The

suds ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY FORM A PATTERN.

INT. NOAH’S CAR – DR. SAXON’S OFFICE - DAY

Noah opens Facebook on his phone and CHECKS-IN his location.

EXT. CAMELBACK MOUNTAIN - DAY

At the summit, Noah takes in the view of Phoenix below: grids

within grids. A SINGLE PLANE courses through the sky, followed by A THICK WHITE CONTRAIL. Noah reaches out with his

thumb and forefinger, as if to crush it.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Noah adjusts his belt in front of a full length mirror.

CLAIRE (O.S.)

I also spoke with Karen and she

said she’d look over your resume. She was doing the hiring at AKO

before she got transferred to their

New York office, so she knows what

to look for.

NOAH

Ok.
Page 8 of 97
Page 9 of 97

7.

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Emphasize your qualities and

strengths!

NOAH

Sure.

Claire walks out of the bathroom, fixing an earring.

CLAIRE

You listening to me or are you just

agreeing with everything I’m

saying?

NOAH

(smiling)

Yep.

EXT. ALICE’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Noah knocks on the front door. Claire holds a birthday

present. A dog barks inside. Claire grasps Noah’s hand.

NOAH

Here we go.

The door opens and a retriever bursts out, followed by Noah’s

nephews, CALEB (8) and SAM (12). Noah gives them a bear hug.

CALEB

Uncle Noah!

SAM

Uncle Noah!

Noah’s sister, ALICE (30’s, ex-artist housewife), and her

husband JIM (40’s, Diamondbacks t-shirt) appear.

ALICE

Hey! Get in here before the dog

goes ape shit. Pringles! Down!

Everyone steps inside. Sam and Caleb run off.

ALICE

(to Noah, sympathetically)

Awww...come here.

He drifts forward into her hug.

ALICE

Those assholes.

NOAH

It’s fine.
Page 9 of 97
Page 10 of 97

8.

ALICE

It’s not fine. Come on, you want

wine or beer?

INT. ALICE’S HOUSE – KITCHEN - NIGHT

Noah stands away from dinner prep, watching the people he

loves. Alice chops vegetables. Jim tastes the red sauce.

Sam and Caleb CLING ADORINGLY TO CLAIRE’S WAIST. She smiles

at Noah from across the room.

INT. ALICE’S HOUSE – DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Spaghetti steams on the table as everyone seats themselves.

CLAIRE

I looked it up and there’s a lot we

can do. Cook dinner at home more.

ALICE

Make lists when you get groceries. Go in with a plan. Sam, you want to

do the honors? It’s your big day!

SAM

Ok...

Alice, Jim, and the kids bow their heads. Noah and Claire

look surprised but do the same.

NOAH

(mock whispering to Alice)

When did you start praying?

ALICE

We’re providing “a spiritual home.” Now shhh! Let Sam do his thing.

SAM

Thank you, God, for the food we are

about to receive. Thank you for a

pretty good birthday. Thank you

also for helping me get chosen in

the rock choir recital. I think it

will be fun. Amen.

EVERYONE

Amen.

They release hands and raise their heads.

CLAIRE

You’re going to be in the choir?

SAM

Rock choir.

CLAIRE

Rock choir. I’m sorry.

ALICE

The school hired a new music

teacher. We think Mr. Flores is

awesome.

Sam looks embarrassed.

JIM

He’s the one...his brother is the

super liberal congressman? That’s a

shadow to live under.

ALICE

That’s why they chose his school to

be the first with all the new eco- friendly upgrades. Well, not “why” per se, but --

CALEB

Solar panels! Global warning!

INT. ALICE’S HOUSE – DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Wrapping paper. Half eaten cake. Alice clears the table.

INT. ALICE’S HOUSE - GARAGE – NIGHT

Noah and Jim sit next to an old car with the hood propped

open. Jim exhales a cloud of smoke and offers Noah A BOWL.

NOAH

I...shouldn’t.

JIM

Take it. Jesus.

Noah takes it, lights, and inhales.

NOAH

(off the bowl)

Holy shit.
Page 11 of 97
Page 12 of 97

10.

JIM

Alice told me what happened. Look, I never knew what I wanted to do

with my life. I knew I didn’t want

to work in my dad’s deli, but

that’s about it. So, I get a

paycheck. I get the health and the

dental and the paid vacation. I get

an awesome wife and kids. And I get

high alone in my garage sometimes.

Right now that’s enough. Pass that

back. Look at this as an

opportunity to figure out what

you’re good at, what you love.

Noah exhales and coughs. He passes the bowl back.

NOAH

You love your job?

JIM

No, of course not. But I have kids. Remember when Sam broke his arm a

couple years ago? You have any idea

what that would have cost without

the insurance?

Jim tokes again. Noah’s phone buzzes. He looks at the screen.

NOAH

(eyes slitted)

We’re heading out. How do I look?

JIM

(exhaling smoke)

You’re going to be okay, buddy.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Noah and Claire enter the house. Claire sniffs:

CLAIRE

Oh God, what is that? Can you take

the trash out, Cheech?

NOAH

Yes ma’am.

Noah opens the cabinet beneath the kitchen sink.

CLAIRE

You coming to bed tonight?
Page 12 of 97
Page 13 of 97

11.

NOAH

I’m going to try.

EXT. NOAH’S HOUSE - ALLEY – NIGHT

Noah, still very high, chucks the bag into a city trash bin.

He turns around and stops, going rigid.

Standing in a pool of light is an EIGHT FOOT TALL, HUMANOID

LIZARD-CREATURE. It has an enlarged, oblong head, and black

eyes blinking at Noah curiously. Neither it, nor Noah, moves.

NOAH

I told you to never come back.

The creature, reflected in Noah’s red eyes, says nothing.

PULL OUT and, standing where the creature was: A MAN WALKING

HIS DOG. The man backs away, yanking at his dog’s leash.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN – NIGHT

Noah locks the back door. He just stands there uneasily.

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Hey hon? Can you make me some tea

since you’re out there?

NOAH ...Sure...

Noah grabs a mug from the cabinet and fills it with water.

NOAH

Uhhh, do you want Sleepytime or

Sweet Dreamz?

CLAIRE (O.S.)

Sweet Dreamz!

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM – LATER THAT NIGHT

The tea cup empty. Claire asleep. Noah tosses and turns.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Noah peeks out the blinds, whiskey in hand. He takes his spot

on the couch, in front of his laptop and the glow of the TV.

FADE TO BLACK

EXT. CHINA BLOSSOM RESTAURANT – EVENING

Brilliant pink sunset. TWO PLANES FLY PERPENDICULAR PATHS as

Noah, now bearded with longer hair, sits on a bench next to

Claire, watches. A DISC buzzes in Claire's lap.

INT. CHINA BLOSSOM RESTAURANT – EVENING

Noah and Claire are halfway through their meal.

CLAIRE

What about Architrust?

NOAH

No. No word.

CLAIRE

You should follow up with them. Jill says they do great work.

NOAH

Ok. I will.

CLAIRE

You ever hear back from ThinkGroup?

Noah says nothing. She reaches across to hold his hand.

CLAIRE

You seem so defeated. You cocoon

yourself up in the house everyday. Where’s the fire inside?

NOAH (PRELAP)

The fire? It’s been more than eight

months. I’ve sent cover letters out

to dozens of firms and haven’t

gotten a single reply. I –-

NOAH (V.O.) -- Wake up each morning and check

the dozen job sites I belong to.

LIVING ROOM: Noah sips coffee, working studiously.

EXT. PHOENIX MOUNTAIN RESERVE – DAY

Noah charges uphill, drenched in sweat.

NOAH (V.O.)

Jog five miles each day when the

job sites reveal nothing.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – INTERCUT ROOMS - DAY

KITCHEN: A blender purees a brown liquid.

NOAH (V.O.)

When that’s done, I chug a protein

shake, then send out cold emails to

firms that aren’t advertising jobs

but maybe will be.

LIVING ROOM: Noah types furiously.

NOAH (V.O.)

After that it’s a toss-up whether I

vacuum the house, do laundry, or

clean the bathrooms. Today just

happened to be vacuuming.

LIVING ROOM: Noah vacuums a tidy home.

INT. CHINABLOSSOM RESTAURANT – EVENING

NOAH

Lather, rinse, repeat. Insert some

minor variation here and there, but

that’s my average day.

Claire pulls her hands out of his and looks at Noah. Hard.

CLAIRE

Are you lying to me or are you just

lying to yourself?

NOAH

What do you mean?

CLAIRE (PRELAP)

You –-

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - INTERCUT ROOMS - MORNING

BEDROOM: Noah lies in a disheveled bed. His eyes peel open.

CLAIRE (V.O.) -- Wake up around 10 or 11. Drink a

pot of coffee while watching Food

Network. Then --

LIVING ROOM: Noah sprawls across the couch in his usual spot.

EXT. PHOENIX MOUNTAIN RESERVE – DAY

Noah walks through the desert, staring at the sky.

CLAIRE (V.O.) -- Whether you run or not, I don’t

know. But you’ve put on about 20

pounds since, you know, all this. Which of course --

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – DAY

KITCHEN: Noah crushes a beer, Chinese food open before him.

CLAIRE (V.O.) -- Is exacerbated by the actually

staggering amount of drinking

you’ve been doing recently. Then --

LIVING ROOM: Noah types furiously.

CLAIRE (V.O.) -- I think you spend several hours

getting into comment battles with

people on Facebook. Or Reddit

maybe? 4Chan? I don’t know.

BEDROOM: Noah makes the bed. A beercan on the side table.

CLAIRE (V.O.)

And yeah, sometimes you clean or

fix dinner, but I don’t care about

that if you’re going to ignore all

the important things in your life.

INT. CHINA BLOSSOM RESTAURANT – EVENING

CLAIRE

You’re giving up on yourself.

NOAH

That’s a –-

The WAITER refills waters. Noah eyes him until he leaves.

NOAH

(slumping, resigned)

-- That’s a half truth. I don’t

know what else to do.

Claire sighs, slurps a noodle. Noah folds into himself.

CLAIRE

What does Dr. Saxon say?

NOAH

Same as you. I should apply myself.

CLAIRE

You have applied yourself. You

still on for 3 O’clock tomorrow?

NOAH

Yeah.

CLAIRE

Ok, but you need to stick with it, stop being so down on yourself. (off Noah’s posture)

Stop hunching up like that every

time we talk about this.

NOAH

Well, I’m fucking sick of talking

about this. It’s all I talk about, with you, mom, Saxon! I haven’t had

a conversation with someone in

months that hasn’t finally drifted

to what an asshole I am.

CLAIRE

You know that’s not what I’m

saying. And if you gave any

indication that you were

accomplishing ...anything!... maybe

we could talk about something else. As it is, I’m working 50 hours a

week while you stay up and fuck

around on your computer all night.
Page 17 of 97
Page 18 of 97

16.

NOAH

It’s the one time of day I don’t

feel guilty for not being a

productive member of society.

Claire finishes her wine. The mood has turned sour.

CLAIRE

I don’t really care about assuaging

your guilt. I’ll only hold your

hand so far. No one can make you

change. Find a passion, a purpose. Figure out what you want to do with

your life. Because this isn’t it.

The waiter drops off the check. They both reach for it, but

CLAIRE GETS IT FIRST and pays the bill while Noah looks on.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN – NIGHT

Noah and Claire enter without saying a word. She stops at the

bedroom and looks back at him; he is already on his laptop.

She slams the bedroom door behind her.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

ON TV: A nature doc. A CATERPILLAR crawls across the screen.

Noah sits in his now familiar spot, his laptop open, a drink

in hand, his face silhouetted by light from the TV.

Noah tops off his drink from a plastic whiskey jug.

ON LAPTOP: Smiling friends on Facebook. Nude celebrities on

Egotastic. A dog farts on Youtube. Noah clicks links on

Reddit. HE CLICKS ONE TITLED “THE ANNUNAKI CONSPIRACY.”

Noah finishes his drink, refills it.

ON TV: A BUTTERFLY emerges from a cocoon.

ON LAPTOP: Noah scrolls down, reading. Scattered in the text

are pictures of The Great Pyramid, Easter Island, and

astrological symbols, until A PHOTO captures his attention.

It bears a STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE LIZARD CREATURE we saw

in the alley several months earlier. Noah considers it

carefully, although he is quite drunk by now.

ON LAPTOP: Noah clicks on the comments section.
Page 18 of 97
Page 19 of 97

17.

ON TV: The butterfly gets tangled in a dewy spider web.

Noah types, pauses, types again. He places his glass down

roughly and falls into the cushions, his gaze now on the TV.

ON TV: The spider wraps the butterfly. THREE DEW DROPS

glisten, a pattern reminiscent of the CONSTELLATION ORION.

Noah passes out, body limp. His laptop still aglow.

ON LAPTOP: “I’ve seen the lizard people. With my eyes.”

FADE TO BLACK

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Noah’s POV: a ceiling fan spins, lit only by TV static.

Claire leans into frame.

CLAIRE

You have an interview! Everything

is set up.

NOAH

Hmm?

CLAIRE

Make me proud.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – MORNING

Noah wakes up on the couch. He drinks the melted ice and

whiskey. He turns on his laptop.

ON LAPTOP SCREEN: There are several replies to his comment, but one stands out. “Please check your email.” The inbox has

ONE NEW MESSAGE from TruthSeeker69 that reads:

“You should be more careful with such honest public

declarations. You are being watched, as you know. Please meet

us at 301 E McDowell today, 3:01PM. Order the Seafood Salad.

If you do not see us, it is because we do not wish to be

seen. –A Friend (?)”

ON THE RADIO: The mystery of birds falling from the sky.
Page 19 of 97
Page 20 of 97

Noah pulls into the office complex and checks in on his

phone. He looks across the intersection at the street sign: E

MCDOWELL; the dashboard clock: 2:45PM.

NOAH

Fuck it. Let’s get seafood salad --

EXT. TACO BEL – DAY

Through the windshield we can see a damaged Taco Bell sign

next to a busy road. It now reads: “Taco Bel”.

NOAH -- At Taco Bell...

INT. TACO BEL - DAY

Noah checks the clock on his phone as he walks cautiously

through the door: 3PM. From a corner booth, MAIA (50’s, long

gray hair) regards him coolly as she sips tea.

TACO BEL CASHIER

Welcome to Taco Bell how may I help

you?

NOAH

I’d like the Seafood Salad. Please.

The cashier looks at him strangely.

TACO BEL CASHIER

What, um, what number is that?

NOAH

I don’t know.

TACO BEL CASHIER

I don’t think we have that.

They stand at an awkward impasse. From behind Noah, a voice:

T.S.

The seafood salad is a mix of baby

shrimp and imitation crab, scooped

over shredded lettuce, diced

tomato, a three cheese blend, and

of course ranch dressing, all

served in a crisp flour tortilla

shell. (MORE)
Page 20 of 97
Page 21 of 97

19.

T.S. (CONT’D)

Sadly it was discontinued in 1987

due to lagging sales by a Reagan- era public still too frightened of

the emasculative femininity

inherent in seafood.

Noah turns around to see T.S. LOPSIA (30’s, a squat, slightly

muscular man with a face like a bulldog beneath an early

graying crew cut). T.S. steps forward.

T.S. Not to mention “salad.” Were it

available today, I would certainly

have the balls to order it. That

said, I will have three Doritos

Locos Tacos Supreme, a small

beverage, and some Cinnastix.

He turns to Noah.

T.S. Noah, would you like to reconsider?

Noah opens his mouth but says nothing.

T.S. (to the cashier)

Double my order. Split the check.

INT. TACO BEL - DAY

T.S. sits at a booth, already halfway through his first taco

when Noah approaches and sits down reluctantly.

The TACO BELL EYE OF HORUS LOGO stares down at them.

NOAH

You know my name?

T.S. If I were to tell you that a planet

named Nibiru, twice the size of

Jupiter, long hidden in orbit

behind the Sun, was on a crash

course towards Earth, what would

your reaction be?

Noah rubs his eyes, lowers his head.

NOAH

This is a mistake.
Page 21 of 97
Page 22 of 97

20.

T.S.

Go on...

NOAH

(sighing)

That’s crazy. If anything that size

were in the galaxy, astronomers

would have discovered it by now.

T.S

Right?

NOAH

Even if, say, it had somehow

maintained a magical path that

defied the laws of orbital

mechanics, it still would have

exerted gravitational anomalies

that gave away its presence.

T.S

Exactly! And yet this is the type

of bullshit I have to deal with

every day. Assholes who are so

stuck on the big picture that they

can’t see the obvious.

NOAH

What are we talking about? And how

do you know my name?

T.S

(taco to his mouth, looking very serious)

I hacked the mainframe.

He takes a bite.

T.S

No. Google. You’re on the message

boards day and night. I didn’t know

that until I saw your post last

night slash this morning and then

dug into your history.

He takes another bite.

T.S

I’m not a creep. But, due

diligence, come on. Like I’m just

going to meet a total stranger

without doing the minimum research.

He swallows, then laughs and slaps the table.
Page 22 of 97
Page 23 of 97

21.

T.S

You have no idea who I am, do you?

Due diligence, man! You can’t post

something like

(whispering) “I’ve seen the fucking Annunaki” and not cover any of your bases!

Eat your tacos, they’re getting

cold.

Noah unwraps his first taco.

NOAH

Ok. You are?

T.S. T.S. For now.

NOAH

Fine, T.S., I’m going to be honest. I only half remember what you

wrote.

T.S. eyes Noah.

T.S. How long you been unemployed? Six

months?

NOAH

How...?

T.S. Again, the boards mostly. You’re

all over the map: politics, religion, weird news. You replied

sporadically before, but then about

six months ago -BOOM!- you’re a

rock star hermit with no pants on

and the time to really get

invested. Plus your LinkedIn says

you’re looking for work. You really

don’t remember what I wrote?

(beat)

And yet here you are.

NOAH

The picture. One of the pictures

was familiar.

T.S. reaches into his bag and pulls out an iPad. He flips it

open but keeps the screen towards him.
Page 23 of 97
Page 24 of 97

22.

T.S. Can you describe the photo to me?

Noah crumples a wrapper.

NOAH

I don’t really feel comfortable

discussing this.

T.S. Then why reach out? Why show up?

Look at you, man, you’re a ball of

nervous energy.

NOAH

I was drunk. It was stupid. I think

maybe I’m mis-remembering.

T.S. Don’t apologize to me about getting

fucked up. “Let him drink, and

forget his poverty, and remember

his misery no more,” as they say. Just describe the picture you saw.

NOAH

It...you know, it looked like a

lizardy man. Big eyes. Ugly.

T.S. smiles and turns the iPad around. It’s open to the same

webpage as before, only the photo is of John D. Rockefeller.

T.S. Which is strange, because I posted

a photo of John D. Rockefeller.

NOAH

(crumpling a wrapper)

Ok, I’m going to head out.

T.S. Come on. We barely talked. “I have

yet many things to say to you, but

you cannot bear them now.”

EXT. TACO BEL – DAY

T.S. chases Noah across the parking lot. Cars rush by.

T.S. Hey! Hey, hold up!

Noah fumbles his car keys.
Page 24 of 97
Page 25 of 97

23.

T.S. One more thing, ok?

NOAH

Look, I wasted your time. I’m

sorry. I take full responsibility.

T.S. If you were being straight with me

then you’re not wasting my time. Alcohol lowers the veil, makes a

man honest. Don’t apologize for who

you are.

NOAH

I have to go.

T.S. Wait! Please. Something terrible is

going to happen, but... (beat)

Maybe you’re not ready to admit

this to yourself, but if you can

actually see the Annunaki, you

could be so incredibly important to

me, to everybody. We need you.

Noah gets in his car, puts it into gear.

T.S. (through the car window)

Oh, you have somewhere to be? Off

to a big meeting? Goddammit, hold

on! Where did you see them?

Noah backs up and rolls down his window.

NOAH

He was walking his dog.

Noah speeds away. T.S. stands alone in the parking lot

beneath the big Taco Bel sign. THREE PLANES FLY PARALLEL, their contrails evenly dividing the sky.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – EVENING

Noah and Claire sit on opposite sides of the couch. Claire

clicks through shows while Noah sips his drink.

24.

EXT. ALICE’S HOUSE – MORNING

Noah pulls up in his car. He honks. The front door opens and

Alice waves at Noah while Sam gets in the car.

INT. NOAH’S CAR - MORNING

Noah pulls the car away.

NOAH

Sam the man! Good morning!

SAM

Morning. Mom says to say thank you

for the ride.

NOAH

How’s Caleb?

SAM

Being a baby. He just has a fever.

NOAH

Your mom doesn’t want anything

happening to you guys. She’s being

a parent.

Silence.

NOAH

How’s school?

SAM

Ok.

NOAH

You still doing rock choir with Mr...

SAM

Flores. Yeah, we practice every day

after school.

Sam looks troubled.

NOAH

You ok, buddy? What’s up?

SAM ...

NOAH

Hey, you don’t have to tell me. But

you can talk to me if you want to.
Page 26 of 97
Page 27 of 97

25.

SAM ...The other kids call me a pussy. Because I’m in the choir and they

play sports.

NOAH

Those motherfuckers. Don’t tell

your mom I said that.

SAM

It’s fine. Dad says it when he

watches the news.

NOAH

Well, look, kids suck. You don’t

suck, but kids do.

NOAH

They’re ridiculously cruel for some

reason. I’m sorry.

SAM

You got picked on?

NOAH

Oh, sure. There was this one kid

who would try to push me down a

flight of stairs every day after

second period. I had to change my

route to class to avoid him.

SAM

(smiling)

Pussy.

NOAH

(smiling back)

Yeah, well, I probably was. Kids

grow out of it. Not all, but most.

EXT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - MORNING

Maria, who we recognize as the crying girl from the first

scene, walks by as CHEERLEADERS practice:

CHEER GIRLS

A - G - H - 2 - O!

Noah pulls up and parks in front of:
Page 27 of 97
Page 28 of 97

26.

Construction tape. Bulldozers. There is a large wooden sign

with the word METATRONIX and a METATRON’S CUBE-INSPIRED LOGO

above an architectural rendering of the school surrounded by

SOLAR PANELS arrayed in a FLOWER OF LIFE pattern.

Beneath this: pictures of THE PHOENIX SEVEN, all old white

men, including one of a smiling C. Clarence Kyle shaking

hands with Marco Flores, the Democratic congressman.

Noah eyes the sign as Sam gets out of the car.

NOAH

Hey, keep your chin up. I can’t

wait to see you in the recital.

SAM

You found a job yet? Mom’s worried.

NOAH

I think I have something lined up.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM – MORNING

Noah is: shaving, brushing his teeth, tying a tie.

INT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ - RECEPTION – DAY

A white modern room. Noah sits, gripping his resume.

Hung on the wall is a piece of VIDEO ART: “The Kitchen V, Carrying the Milk” by Marina Abramovic. Marina’s hands shake, and a few drops from the bowl hit the floor.

Seconds tick by. More milk spills. Noah tightens his grasp.

RECEPTIONIST

Mr. Kyle will see you now.

INT. KYLE CONSTRUCTION HQ - KYLE’S OFFICE – DAY

Two large old wooden doors. A knock.

C. CLARENCE KYLE (O.S.)

Come in!

Noah enters. The office is impossibly large. White marble

floors in a perfect grid, the coffered ceiling mimicking the

floor pattern: one coffer per seven tiles, seven times.

At the far end is C. CLARENCE KYLE (70’s), an impeccably

dressed conservative businessman.
Page 28 of 97
Page 29 of 97

27.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

You’re going to have to come

closer. I’m afraid I can barely see

you over there.

Noah comes closer.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Noah Ev-em-eras, yes?

NOAH

Evemeras. Yes sir, I...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

You used to work for me.

NOAH

Yes. They said if things picked

up...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And now you want your old job back?

NOAH

Yes. Yes, I think that I’d...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

We’d have to offer you a

significant pay cut. The economy, you understand.

NOAH

Yes. I understand. The economy.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

A 35% cut. Does that sound fair?

Given the situation?

A hidden door opens on one wall and a small Hispanic woman

wearing a brilliant red kimono enters, placing a gold tray in

front of Kyle. On the tray is a head-to-tail salmon with the

midsection carved into sashimi. She turns and leaves.

Kyle eats with gold chopsticks and looks at Noah expectantly.

NOAH

...35? Of course, that seems fair.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And your benefits would not kick in

again for some time.

Noah nods.
Page 29 of 97
Page 30 of 97

28.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Health. Dental. 401k. For several

years at the very least.

Noah nods again, defeated. C. Clarence Kyle is already

halfway finished with the salmon.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

All of this is predicated on your

immediate re-hire --

NOAH

Thank you. Being unemployed...I’m

beginning to die inside.

C. CLARENCE KYLE -- Which we will not be doing.

Noah raises his eyes questioningly.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

What do they say about business, Noah?

Noah opens his mouth, but says nothing.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

It’s not what you know –-

Kyle waits.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Come on. It’s not what you know --

NOAH

It’s who you know.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And who do you know?

NOAH

Well, I only moved here a few years

ago. For the job. My uncle...You

and he were quite close.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And when we hired you, he was alive

and well. An influential man. I

always liked him, if not

personally.

NOAH

He died several months ago.
Page 30 of 97
Page 31 of 97

29.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

I attended the funeral. (beat, chewing)

His influence has waned since then.

NOAH

So...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

So when we hired you, you were

useful, you served a purpose. And

now you are not, you do not.

NOAH

I bring some skills to the table.

Kyle stands up, the salmon reduced to head and tail.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

When we let you go the first time, you said, “I never fit in here,” is

that right?

He circles the table.

NOAH

I...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Did you even want this job? Do you

appreciate what we do?

NOAH

Yes, of course, I...

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Because I have seen your emails, read the litany of complaints, seen

the recesses of your mind, and you

haaaaated it here, at this company

that has been my life’s work.

He circles behind Noah.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And yet here you are, begging to

take back a job you hated at a

company you loathed. A job you took

solely out of the fear that without

it you would disappoint everyone

who’s supported you expectantly

along the way.
Page 31 of 97
Page 32 of 97

30.

Noah turns reluctantly to see Kyle standing before a tufted

white leather sofa, above which is a LARGE OIL PAINTING BY

JOHN GAST, “AMERICAN PROGRESS”. Kyle stares at it, entranced.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

And you have been supported, coddled. You’re more baby than man.

Do you know what I am?

Kyle, framed by the painting, spins to glare at Noah.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

I am a world builder. When I came

here there was nothing, just vast

tracts of dirt and rocks. I brought

water. I brought power. I brought

the trees, and I brought men. Roads. Bridges. Homes. Life!

Everything you see I created from

willpower and balls. Not once have

you shown me balls!

NOAH

(meekly)

Did you just bring me here to

humiliate me?

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Humiliate you? Does the truth, dared to be spoken aloud, make you

blush? Can you admit even to

yourself what you are?

NOAH

I...

Noah drops his gaze, eyes brimming. Kyle approaches.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

I HOLD MY HEAD HIGH! I AM A WORLD

BUILDER! YOU ARE --

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – EARLY MORNING

Noah is splayed across the couch, no pants, his head hanging

low off the side. Vomit drips from his mouth, forming a pool

on the floor. Claire stands over him.

CLAIRE

Hey.

He doesn’t stir, barely opens his eyes.
Page 32 of 97
Page 33 of 97

31.

CLAIRE

The power’s out.

NOAH

What?

CLAIRE

The power is out. You pay the bill?

Noah sits up.

NOAH

Yeah. I think. You sure it’s out?

CLAIRE

I am sure. (off the stained couch)

The fuck is that?

NOAH

Oh, I spilled something.

CLAIRE

Fuck! I don’t have time for this, Noah. Can you pay the goddamn power

bill like an adult so we have

electricity again?

NOAH

I...

CLAIRE

What?

NOAH

I don’t know if I have enough in my

account. But I also don’t know what

the bill is! Maybe I can float it!

Claire turns away from him. She dials her cell phone.

CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)

John? Hey, listen I’m going to be

running late. Start the meeting

without me. Just some things I have

to deal with at home. I’m sorry. I

know! An hour, max, I promise.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Noah sits in the dark, head in hands. Claire paces in the

bedroom down the hall, surrounded by bills and envelopes.
Page 33 of 97
Page 34 of 97

32.

CLAIRE (INTO PHONE)

Account number 9572...

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Noah doesn’t react when the door slams as Claire leaves.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN – DAY

Noah, shirtless, smokes a joint while he wipes out a melting

freezer. He stares. Frost in the back forms TESSELLATING

PATTERNS as he --

A WHIRRING SOUND breaks the spell. The power is back on.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM – DAY

Noah lays on the stained couch, game controller in hand, headset on. Another joint burns in an ashtray.

NOAH (INTO HEADSET)

How you like me now you hillbilly

piece of shit?

ON TV: He races around a Middle Eastern compound, killing

other players. Bloody red text: “ROUND LOSS.”

NOAH (INTO HEADSET)

Fuuuuck. Youuuuu.

Noah’s laptop beeps.

ON LAPTOP: Email from TruthSeeker69. Other tabs are visible – “Why the Annunaki need,” “The Nibiru Cataclysm,” “Reptiloid

Draconians” – but only his email is open. It reads:

T.S. (V.O.)

Noah, we got off to a bad start. I

think your skills could be

incredibly valuable to my

organization. Please meet me for an

informational meeting and apology

beer at the Swizzle Inn.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN – LATER THAT DAY

Noah roots in the fridge for a beer but comes back empty.
Page 34 of 97
Page 35 of 97

33.

INT. SWIZZLE INN – DAY

A classic dive. Musty, cluttered, and dark. T.S. sits at the

bar alone. The door opens, letting in too much daylight. T.S. squints and waves Noah over.

LATER: Noah and T.S. sip their beers in silence.

T.S. Can I ask you something?

NOAH

Sure.

T.S. So I’m clear, what did you mean

when you said, “I’ve seen them?”

Noah sips his beer, inhales as if to speak, then sips again.

NOAH

There have been times...

Noah stalls, suddenly interested in his napkin.

NOAH

About 10 years ago...I was walking

to class and there it was, just for

a second, sitting in an Escalade at

a red light. I thought someone was

wearing a mask, you know, like that

picture you had, but when I looked

again it was just a guy.

T.S. So just that one time?

NOAH

No. For a while I’d see them quite

regularly: at the bank, the gym, teaching my classes.

Noah sighs, then speaks rapidly, the way people do when

glossing over something important.

NOAH

Long story short, I tried to kill

myself. That didn’t work out, so

they hospitalized me and put me on

a combination of antipsychotics and

carbamazepine. They said I had some

form of “peduncular hallucinosis.”
Page 35 of 97
Page 36 of 97

34.

T.S. They would say that. Are you still

taking them?

NOAH

Not exactly. My insurance ran out a

while ago, but I was trying to wean

myself off even before that. The

meds. The therapy.

NOAH

It felt false, like I wasn’t living

my life, just watching it.

Noah finishes his beer, picks at the label.

NOAH

Aside from my doctor, I’ve never

really discussed this with anyone. My family thinks I have anxiety.

(laughs)

I do, I suppose...

T.S. When you have a gift like this, the

response we’re trained to have is

shame. But, once you see behind the

curtain, man...

NOAH

I don’t know what I saw. All dreams

feel real when you’re in them.

T.S. But the creatures, they looked like

what you saw in my picture?

Noah nods.

T.S. What are the odds of that?

INT. SWIZZLE INN – EARLY EVENING

Noah and T.S. are now drinking whiskey.

NOAH

So, you’re what? UFO hunters?
Page 36 of 97
Page 37 of 97

35.

T.S. (lowering his voice)

I am the president of an

organization that tracks the

movements and actions of the

Annunaki –-

NOAH -- a race of reptilian alien

overlords who secretly control us?

T.S. It won’t be a secret much longer. I’m finishing my book, which is why

I wanted to meet you! They’re

everywhere, as you know.

NOAH

I wouldn’t say...

T.S. You have to look between

geopolitical actions to see them. Find meaning in patterns that

others don’t see.

NOAH

You’ve never seen one?

T.S. I have not.

NOAH

Yet you believe these aliens exist?

T.S.

I do. You’ve seen them, and yet you

insist they don’t. Who’s the crazy

one?

(beat)

They were the gods of Sumer and

they remain the titans of industry, finance, and technology to this

day. They are, quite literally, “the invisible hand.”

NOAH

So you plan to expose them. Why?

T.S. Something has changed. My research

indicates they’re planning... something. Look, I can read books

all day, but I seek gnosis.

(MORE)
Page 37 of 97
Page 38 of 97

36.

T.S. (CONT’D)

(considers his words)

When you tried to kill yourself, did you leave your life a wreck?

Noah looks down.

NOAH

No. I cleaned my apartment, paid my

bills, closed my accounts. I felt

relief. As close to happy as I had

in a long time.

T.S. gestures at the TV above the bar.

ON TV: a NEWS GRAPHIC SHOWS U.S. INCOME INEQUALITY.

T.S.

You see? Same thing. Cleaning their

mess. Accumulating the wealth. These aren’t the decisions of a

ruling class with long term goals. Those days are over. So they take

your money. They take your power.

NOAH

They take your job.

Noah throws back his drink.

NOAH

You keep saying “something” is

going to happen. “Something” terrible. What?

Now T.S. finishes his drink. For the first time, his

confidence wavers.

T.S. I don’t know. I have the pieces --

He reaches into his bag and pulls out a thick MANILA FOLDER

crammed with documents.

T.S. -- But I can’t put them together. That’s why we need you.

Noah’s phone buzzes. He answers it.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Hey. No. I’m at a meeting. An

interview. Because I didn’t think

you wanted to talk to me. I already

apologized. Ok, I’m sorry!

(MORE)
Page 38 of 97
Page 39 of 97

37.

NOAH (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)

I fucked up. Later. Maybe if you

stopped yelling I would...Yes you

are!

T.S. gestures to the bartender for two shots.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

I have to go. Blame me all you

want. I’m aware this is my fault.

Noah hangs up the phone.

NOAH

Sorry. Girlfriend.

Noah’s phone buzzes again. Text message. He reads it aloud:

NOAH “Don’t bother coming home tonight

you fucking –-"

The phone buzzes a third time.

NOAH

Ah, it’s a two parter. “-- Fuckity

fuck fuck.”

T.S. slides a shot across the bar to Noah. They stare

straight ahead - CLINK - and down them simultaneously.

INT. SWIZZLE INN - MEN’S ROOM – EVENING

Noah grips the sink and clenches his eyes closed as he

hunches over, choking on his own frustration.

T.S. glides into the bathroom and stands behind Noah.

NOAH

What?

T.S. places a hand on Noah’s shoulder.

T.S. You seem to be going through a bit

of a rough patch.

NOAH

Look man, I barely...
Page 39 of 97
Page 40 of 97

38.

T.S. I know. We just met, but all of my

data indicates the Annunaki are

coordinating what will be a

catastrophic worldwide event. I

don’t know where. I don’t know

what. I don’t know when. I’m trying

to defuse a bomb I can’t even see. (beat)

But I see something in you. I see a

man whose true talents are going to

waste because they pose a direct

threat to the powers that be.

T.S.

What better way to keep a man down

than to make him believe he belongs

there? You need to stop being so

hard on yourself and --

T.S. squeezes Noah’s shoulder muscle.

T.S. -- Jesus! You are a ball of

tension. When was the last time you

let yourself have some fun?

NOAH

It’s been a while.

T.S. dangles a bag of coke in front of Noah’s face.

T.S. You’re partying with me tonight. And then you’re going to help me

with my research.

He puts a spoon up to Noah’s nostril. Noah snorts in deeply.

NOAH

Yeah. Ok.

T.S. puts another spoonful beneath Noah’s other nostril.

T.S. This is the start of something

great.

PARTY MONTAGE!

39.

INT. SWIZZLE INN – NIGHT

Noah and T.S. stand by the juke box smiling, laughing, and

fucked out of their heads. Noah gestures wildly.

T.S. So, wait, even the dog disappeared?

NOAH

Gone!

T.S. Oh, that is so fucked up!

INT. DANCE CLUB - BOOTH – NIGHT

Noah and T.S. huddle over the manila folder. T.S. hands Noah

papers and does a shot. Noah looks them over.

T.S. We’re talking manganese, cadmium, aluminum. Thousands of times the

maximum containment level! In our

air, our water, our food.

NOAH

What’s that mean?

T.S. These are heavy metals, man, but

get this: the EPA, Department of

Health, no one will say it’s

carcinogenic!

INT. IRISH PUB – NIGHT

T.S. tries to flag down a bartender.

NOAH

(shouting)

All these birds are dying midair. And now I’m finding them on my car. I gotta think it means something.

INT. CLUB #2 - BATHROOM – NIGHT

Noah and T.S. do lines off the sink. Music throbs outside.

T.S. The conspiracy is vast. It is

powerful. (MORE)
Page 41 of 97

40.

T.S. (CONT’D)

And it doesn’t matter where you

look, be it The Bilderberg Group, The Trilateral Commission, fuck

even the Masons --

Someone pounds on the door.

T.S. Occupied! -- They’re all part of

the same lineage going back to

Sumerian deities. You familiar?

Noah, head tilted back, shakes “no.”

T.S. No worries. We’ll get you up to

speed.

EXT. CLUB #2 - BACK ALLEY – NIGHT

Noah cries. T.S. leans in. A HOMELESS MAN tries to sleep.

NOAH

Months now and no job! I can’t...I

can’t fucking get out of this.

He looks at his phone, despairing.

NOAH

She hasn’t called back!

EXT. STREET – NIGHT

Noah and T.S. stumble down the sidewalk, smoking a joint.

T.S., with the air of an eager personal assistant, continues

to press papers into Noah’s hands.

T.S. Holes in the ozone layer! Climate

change! Solar storms! Every year

they get worse! But what if these

aren’t side effects?

NOAH

(scrutinizing a document)

What if they’re the point?

GREEN NEON LIGHT washes over them. Noah looks up to see a

bright sign reading, LEOPARD & LACE GENTLEMAN’S CLUB.
Page 42 of 97
Page 43 of 97

41.

INT. LEOPARD & LACE GENTLEMAN’S CLUB – NIGHT

T.S. gets a lap dance from CASSIE (20s, blonde) while Noah, bleary eyed, observes the scene.

T.S. (to Cassie)

People are petting it, feeding it, saying, “ohh, how cute!” But it’s

not even there! Holographic dog!

FAMILIAR LAUGHTER: Art, Dave, and Pete, the laughing

businessmen from Noah’s firing, are across the room. ANOTHER

MAN (40’s, tall) holds a METATRONIX CREDIT CARD.

Noah furrows his brow.

T.S. (off the businessmen)

You know them?

NOAH

Yeah, that’s Art, Dave, uh, Pete. They’re...I used to work with...

A PHLEGMY CHEER goes up at the businessmen’s table when the

waitress returns with a gold tray of vodka shots.

CU the reflection in Noah’s eyes: vodka pours into Metatronix

Man’s mouth and, as the glass lowers, HE BECOMES ANNUNAKI.

Noah gasps and goes rigid.

NOAH

Do you see?

T.S. Do I see what?

NOAH

It’s like they’re underwater. Or, a

TV with bad reception, but...

Noah points at the group, but T.S. grabs him by the wrist.

T.S. Don’t let on that you know! It’s

not safe.

A NEW SONG purrs as we follow Noah’s gaze across the club: A

BLURRY, STACCATO CARNIVAL OF REPTILIAN SIN.

An Annunaki, sitting in Art’s chair, flicks a forked tongue

against a YOUNG DANCER’s arched neck, as if to bite her.
Page 43 of 97
Page 44 of 97

42.

Sweat drips down Noah’s face.

NOAH

I have to...I have to do something.

A scream from somewhere! Noah leaps to his feet.

Annunaki writhe and surge in the small space. Noah tries to

form a fist, but can’t stop shaking. A TOPLESS WOMAN runs

past, blood pouring from her nose. A BOUNCER pushes by.

T.S. gestures at the businessmen’s table: they’re gone.

Noah pushes through the crowd, throws open a side door, and

stumbles upon an ANNUNAKI FUCKING SOME POOR GIRL in a back

room. It hisses and roars! Noah slams the door shut and --

EXT. LEOPARD & LACE GENTLEMAN’S CLUB - NIGHT

-- bursts into the parking lot and falls to his knees, gagging in the orange pool of a streetlight. T.S. catches up.

NOAH

It was fucking her! The...Annunaki.

T.S. “The sons of God saw the daughters

of men that they were fair; and

they took them wives of all which

they chose. And the lord...”

NOAH

Stop! Why did you bring me here?

T.S.

They can always be found where

there’s money. And sex. You needed

to see firsthand what they’re

capable of.

T.S crouches next to Noah and eyes the businessmen, who are

now across the lot.

T.S. Are you familiar with the concept

of menis?

NOAH

(gasping)

Menace?
Page 44 of 97
Page 45 of 97

43.

T.S. “I-S” not “A-C-E”. Menis. It’s an

old word. Greek. Meaning, roughly, “the anger that remains.”

Noah shakes his head: no.

T.S. You think you’re afraid right now, but you’re not. You stood in a room

with them, watched them. I can only

imagine the willpower that took.

NOAH

They were...feeding off the girls.

T.S. They do that. The Annunaki feed off

fear. And, as you saw, the girls

had good reason to be afraid. But

they didn’t feed off you, did they?

Noah, calmer, stands and wipes at the corner of his mouth.

T.S. Because you’re not afraid of them. You think you are. You think that

emotion you’re choking down is

fear, or sadness, or shame.

Art drives up in a black car. Noah blocks the road, but Art

doesn’t recognize him and honks while revving his engine. He

honks again. A tense beat. Noah steps aside. Art speeds by.

T.S.

What you’re feeling is rage.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – NIGHT

Books are everywhere -- history, religion, conspiracy, ufos, classics, ethnobotany -- but the meticulously clean apartment

feels like a monastic cell.

Noah sleeps on a couch. We hear a crash and clatter, then

T.S. returns with a glass of water and shakes Noah. Noah

opens his eyes.

T.S. I’m glad you decided to meet with

me. We’ve got a lot of work ahead

of us and not much time. Here.

T.S. gives him a handful of pills.
Page 45 of 97
Page 46 of 97

44.

NOAH

The fuck are these?

T.S. This is ginger, for your stomach... Ashwagandha, a nerve tonic...N- Acetyl Cysteine. Oh, and that’s

Prickly Pear extract --

Noah swallows them all, passes out. T.S. pulls a blanket over

Noah and regards him protectively as he sleeps.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – MORNING

Noah wakes up, finds the bathroom, and takes a long piss.

INT. NOAH’S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM - DAY

Noah dusts the coffee table, placing a vase of fresh flowers

in the center. He clears dirty dishes, a wine bottle, and

picks up CLAIRE’S OPEN LAPTOP. It awakens from the movement. We see bits of an email chain between her and FLORESJ at 2am.

ON LAPTOP: “so frustrated,” “shouldn’t be talking to you.”

Noah puts the laptop down. He stands quietly in the room.

EVENING: The house is shiny and clean. Noah sits in his spot

on the couch, drink in hand. Keys rattle. Claire enters.

CLAIRE

Hey.

NOAH

Hey.

CLAIRE

(off the clean house)

You didn’t have to...

NOAH

I wanted to. I was mostly done

anyway when --

CLAIRE

When what?

NOAH -- Your email opened.
Page 46 of 97
Page 47 of 97

45.

CLAIRE

Oh, it just opened? By itself?

NOAH

I picked it up to clean your dishes

off the table, yeah.

CLAIRE

And?

NOAH

Who is he?

CLAIRE

(quietly)

I have been so, so patient with

you. Why do you get to stand here

and accuse me?

NOAH

Who the fuck is he?

Noah’s phone buzzes across the room. He ignores it.

CLAIRE

Nobody! You forgot to pick Sam up

yesterday. It was why I called.

Noah stares at her.

CLAIRE

His music teacher was waiting with

him. I gave him my email to be on

the listserv. But then we started

talking. He said I looked sad.

Noah stands up.

NOAH

So we have one fight and you go for

some other guy?

CLAIRE

It’s not one fight! It’s the

thousand fights we’re not having. It’s me keeping my mouth shut while

you drift along in self-pity or

apathy or whatever the fuck it is

that’s going on inside your head

but I certainly don’t know because

you don’t tell me anything anymore. So did I talk to another guy? Yeah, you caught me red handed in the... emails of another man. (MORE)
Page 47 of 97
Page 48 of 97

46.

CLAIRE (CONT’D)

Do you have any idea how nice it

was to talk to someone where, just

for a moment, I wasn’t forced to be

the nag? Besides, you weren’t home

last night and even when you are

home you might as well not be.

NOAH

You told me not to come home.

CLAIRE

You were drunk already. You’re

drinking now.

CLAIRE

I found your roaches under the

table. You can afford that shit, go

to bars, but you can’t pay the

fucking power bill?

Noah’s phone buzzes again. He stops the buzzing.

NOAH

I’ve paid those bills on time for

years. I forgot one time!

CLAIRE

But you’re forgetting everything!

You’re so wrapped up in your stupid

sadness you’re shutting everyone

else out. And you know what? It’s

not that bad. You have a roof over

your head. You ate today. You have

people who care about you.

NOAH

Knowing that only makes me feel

worse. Every time you tell me to

smile or tell me things will be

better, I try to believe that.

CLAIRE

You act like this is only happening

to you, but it’s happening to us. (beat)

I’m almost 30, Noah. I’m watching

my friends get married, buy houses, have children. We’ve already burned

through your savings, we’re burning

through mine, and you’ve stopped

making any effort to find work.
Page 48 of 97
Page 49 of 97

47.

NOAH

That’s not true. I think I found an

internship with this guy.

Noah’s phone buzzes a third time. He shows it to Claire.

NOAH

See? He’s calling me. I’ve been

ignoring his calls so we can talk.

Claire walks to the refrigerator.

CLAIRE

Take the call.

Noah answers the phone.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Hello?

INTERCUT with T.S. inside his truck, parked across the street

from Metatronix Corporate Headquarters.

T.S. (INTO PHONE)

Noah! I found our man. Well, “man” quote unquote. Cassie looked

through last night’s receipts.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Are you at Metatronix?

Claire looks up at Noah while pouring a glass of wine.

T.S. (INTO PHONE)

Yeah! How’d you know?

T.S. watches a stream of people exit the Metatronix building.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

I could have just told you that.

T.S. (INTO PHONE)

Can we meet? I have some things I

want to discuss with you about

moving forward.

T.S. doesn’t recognize C. Clarence Kyle in his gold Jaguar.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

I don’t think tonight will work.

CLAIRE

Just go.
Page 49 of 97
Page 50 of 97

48.

NOAH

(hand on receiver)

What?

CLAIRE

Just go.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Hold on.

CLAIRE

Go! We’re done talking. If this is

potentially work related, then go.

Noah hesitates.

NOAH (INTO PHONE)

Pick me up in 20. You need the

address?

T.S. (INTO PHONE)

Nope.

Noah nods as though he knew this would be the answer, then

hangs up. Claire sits down.

CLAIRE

I think we need to take a break. We

can’t keep having this same

conversation, talking in circles. Nothing makes you happy.

NOAH

You make me happy.

CLAIRE

I used to. I don’t know anymore.

NOAH

You do. I promise.

CLAIRE

Maybe a little time apart will

remind you of that. It’ll give you

something to fight for.

EXT. NOAH’S HOUSE – NIGHT

T.S.’ truck pulls up. Noah gets in.

NOAH (V.O.)

Tell me we’re getting fucked up.
Page 50 of 97
Page 51 of 97

49.

T.S. (V.O.)

We just got to introduce you to

everyone first.

The truck tears off down the road. A BLACK CAR follows.

INT. T.S.’S TRUCK - NIGHT

T.S. reaches behind the driver’s seat and hands Noah a beer.

T.S. I want to talk to you about

something. I have a theory.

NOAH

Shoot.

T.S. Let’s assume the Annunaki are

exploiting some aspect of our brain

chemistry to disguise their

appearance. But your brain is

different. When you’re stressed out

or fucked up, something changes and

all of a sudden you’re seeing the

world the way it really is.

T.S. sees Noah eyeing the rear view mirrors.

T.S. What’s up?

NOAH

I’m not...Are we being followed?

T.S. jerks to alertness. The black car is still there.

T.S. Where? Him? Them? Is it them?

NOAH

The windows are blacked out!

T.S. FUUCK. Ok, Ok. No need to panic.

T.S. drives calmly but evasively. He continues talking:

T.S. As I was saying. You can, from time

to time, see past the false world

we’re told we live in.
Page 51 of 97
Page 52 of 97

50.

T.S. makes a sharp turn.

T.S. You are burdened with the gift of

reality.

NOAH

But I can’t maintain it long enough

to do anything! It’s minutes or

seconds then it’s gone.

Noah looks behind him.

NOAH

Shit. It’s them. You just came from

Metatronix, didn’t you?

T.S. nods tersely then makes another hard, controlled turn

down a side road. The black car seemingly follows. T.S. picks

up his cell phone while gunning the gas.

T.S. (INTO PHONE)

It’s me. Epsilon Oblivion. Don’t

make me say it twice.

T.S. hangs up and drives tactically to evade the black car.

Noah grips the door. T.S. parks behind a bush and shuts off

the lights. He chugs a beer as the BLACK CAR DRIVES BY. He

crushes the can, pulls out, and drives the way they came.

EXT. DESERT ESTATES - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The truck races past the FRAMES OF UNFINISHED MCMANSIONS.

INT. T.S.’S TRUCK - DESERT ESTATES - NIGHT

Noah and T.S. bounce in the speeding cab. T.S. is on a tear:

T.S. Ask yourself: does the government

have an interest in preventing our

fullest spiritual potential?

Headlights reveal a refurbished police car parked on a gravel

cul-de-sac. The truck skids to a stop. Noah and T.S. hop out.

T.S. The inevitable answer that comes

back to you, any way you look at

it, is a conclusive yes. And you’re

fucking up their plan.
Page 52 of 97
Page 53 of 97

51.

EXT. DESERT ESTATES - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

ARTHUR (60’s, ponytail) gets out of the police car and tosses

a screwdriver to T.S., who removes his own license plates.

T.S. (to Arthur)

You see any lights behind us?

ARTHUR

Nah. You’re clear, I think.

T.S. You think?

Arthur puts on night vision goggles and scans the desert.

ARTHUR

You’re clear.

T.S. looks approvingly at Noah, who looks bewildered. Arthur

pulls a gas can from his trunk and hands it to T.S.

ARTHUR

Epsilon Oblivion. That’s intense.

NOAH

What’s Epsilon Oblivion?

ARTHUR

We got it under control. Step back. No one’s tracking you. Not today.

T.S. addresses Noah while pouring gas on his truck:

T.S. You did good tonight.

T.S. lights a match and IGNITES THE TRUCK.

T.S. Ah, dammit!

NOAH

What? What?

T.S. scrambles toward the truck but is pushed back by flames.

T.S. I left beer in the back seat! Shit!

ARTHUR

There’s always more beer. Come on, time to go.
Page 53 of 97
Page 54 of 97

52.

The truck burns in the desert night.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – NIGHT

Candles everywhere. Noah, T.S., and Arthur walk in. SUSAN

(40’s, librarian-esque) seated, and JOHNNY (20’s, too thin)

at a podium, stare at Noah. Arthur directs Noah to sit.

T.S. Thanks for getting here on short

notice.

JOHNNY

Bring out the cone of silence!

T.S. No...

ALL (EXCEPT NOAH)

The cone of silence.

Johnny, Susan, and Arthur place tinfoil hats on their heads.

Noah reluctantly puts on his own hat. The lights dim.

JOHNNY

(in Latin, dramatically)

Petite et dabitur vobis quaerite et

invenietis pulsate et...

T.S. Stop. Stop! Take them off.

JOHNNY

Aw, come on man.

T.S. (to Noah)

We were going to do this whole tin

foil hat thing.

Johnny balls up his hat and throws it gently at Noah.

JOHNNY

I spent a lot of time on that.

SUSAN

That was $20 worth of tinfoil.

NOAH

(apologetic)

Sorry, we...
Page 54 of 97
Page 55 of 97

53.

T.S. We had an Epsilon Oblivion. Twenty

minutes ago.

SUSAN

Were you followed back here?

JOHNNY

Are you ok?

T.S. The truck’s taken care of and the

plates wouldn’t lead back to me or

any of you. Noah caught it in time.

Arthur pats Noah on the back.

ARTHUR

Thanks, buddy.

JOHNNY

But that’s way advanced on the time

line. Why are you being followed?

T.S. takes Johnny’s place at the podium. A SLIDESHOW of UFO

sightings plays behind him.

T.S. I’d like you all to meet Noah.

NOAH

Hi...

T.S. Noah, there are others like us, though none are like you. (suddenly serious)

We are Targeted Individuals. We –-

Johnny sighs. T.S. glares at Johnny.

T.S. -- through no fault of our own, have had our lives destroyed and

our sanity questioned.

SUSAN

(pleading tone)

Because we choose not to adhere to

the dogmas of society, we have been

oppressed or shunned by the highest

branches of world governments.
Page 55 of 97
Page 56 of 97

54.

JOHNNY

And by our families, yo.

T.S. The less you fit in, the more

you’re shut out. (to Johnny)

You asked why we were followed. Noah here, can see them, if only

briefly at the moment.

SUSAN

(to Noah)

How do you see? They built towers

near my home and I hear their

transmissions like a hum in the

back of my head: “Buy Oreos.” “Step

in front of that bus.”

NOAH

I don’t know. It just happens.

JOHNNY

What do you see, exactly?

NOAH

I can see the Annunaki. Sometimes.

The room considers this information in silence.

T.S. When the Annunaki created Man, we, like they, had twelve strands of

DNA, not just the two that remain. Scientists call it “junk” now, but

it was through these quadruple

helix structures that we first

experienced the world.

Susan closes her eyes and nods in agreement.

JOHNNY

If you look at cave paintings or

early art, they just straight up

draw the Annunaki. But then it’s

like --

Johnny gestures as though a plane is crashing.

JOHNNY -- and you can see people’s eyes or

whatever get messed up.
Page 56 of 97
Page 57 of 97

55.

SUSAN

Ezekiel described them as best he

could, but it’s overwhelming.

T.S. To make up for this, we gave our

priests and shamans mind altering

substances so they might converse

with the gods as we did before. Now, with Noah’s help, maybe we

can, too. Before it’s too late.

JOHNNY

(to Noah)

Has he shown you the solar storm

spreadsheet? Crazy shit.

T.S. (talking over Johnny)

It will mean finding the right

combination of substances to open

his gift in a way he can control.

ARTHUR

So, you’re going to take a shit-ton

of drugs?

T.S. Yes. Yes we are.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – DAY

HOME VIDEO CAMERA POV: A yellow legal pad with a hand written

note reads, “OPERATION TIGER’S EYE TEST 1”.

NOAH

Test 1: alcohol. Because the

Annunaki are among the rich and

powerful, I will watch both Fox

News and MSNBC for signs of them.

LATER: Noah clutches a whiskey bottle while watching two TVs.

T.S. Anything?

NOAH

No. Hooo! Wait...just Ann Coulter.

T.S. Not funny.

LATER: T.S. quizzes Noah with flash cards as they do shots.
Page 57 of 97
Page 58 of 97

56.

T.S. Adad.

NOAH

God of storms.

T.S. Nergal.

NOAH

God of war...and the Sun in its

destructive capacity?

T.S. Good work. Take a shot.

EXT. SUSAN’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

Noah, T.S., Arthur, and Susan sit on folding chairs facing a

MASSIVE CELL PHONE TOWER at the edge of her rural property.

They take hits from a GRAY ALIEN BONG:

SUSAN

My husband...ex-husband, called me

from the patio. I’d never seen

anything like it.

ARTHUR

I stepped out of the bar and a “V” shape filled the sky.

T.S. The “Phoenix Lights” were unlike

other sightings. The ships, flight

patterns: all different. (to Noah)

You feeling it? Anything?

Noah wiggles his fingers in the air.

NOAH

Just at the peripheries. (to Susan, off the tower)

That hum? Is it always there?

SUSAN

You hear it? I can’t sleep anymore.

ARTHUR

(to Susan)

What hum?
Page 58 of 97
Page 59 of 97

57.

SUSAN

Like a HHNNNNNNNN sound?

T.S. hands the bong back to Noah. He jots down --

T.S. “Heightened auditory awareness”

-- on his legal pad. Noah takes a hit, staring at the tower.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – MORNING

HOME VIDEO CAMERA POV: OPERATION TIGER’S EYE TEST 9. Noah

addresses the camera while T.S. wanders in the bg.

NOAH

The coca plant played a key role in

facilitating conversations between

Annunaki and Incan priests. (beat)

Let’s get spiritual up in this

bitch.

He FREEBASES CRACK COCAINE, exhaling smoke at the camera.

LATER: Open books and papers everywhere.

NOAH

When did you say the first Phoenix

Lights event took place?

T.S. ‘97.

NOAH

And again in 2005? 2007?

T.S. Yeah. Why?

NOAH

Check this out. The sightings line

up with your solar storm data.

T.S. Nice work! Load another bowl.

LATER: Noah paces as T.S. races through flash cards.

T.S. Ea.
Page 59 of 97
Page 60 of 97

58.

NOAH

Ruler of Earth and Men!

T.S. Until...

NOAH

Until he ceded the throne to

Marduk, patron deity of Babylon!

Keep ‘em coming!

T.S. Ereshkigal.

NOAH

Goddess of the underworld. I can do

this all day!

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – NIGHT

The apartment: spotless. Noah: sleeping, duster in hand.

ON TV: A new CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAl for MARCO FLORES featuring

the solar panel project. “You can believe in Flores.”

EXT. PUBLIC PARK – DAY

Noah rolls in the grass while T.S. films him.

T.S. Hawaiin Baby Wood Rose is causing a

powerfully dissociative state. What

are you seeing?

Noah stares as A FLOCK OF DOVES take flight, then lands. A

TRUE GEOMETRIC PATTERN TAKES SHAPE.

Noah vomits violently.

INT. T.S.’ TRUCK - BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 – DAY

Construction has progressed. Solar panels now circle the

school grounds. A sign announces: “Rock Out with Rock Choir!”

Noah, T.S. and Arthur drink beers in the cab. Noah observes

the school through binoculars. He ducks down in his seat as

Claire comes out the front door with Sam and Sam’s music

teacher, Mr. Flores.

NOAH

Javier Flores. That fucking guy.
Page 60 of 97
Page 61 of 97

59.

ARTHUR

Who?

T.S. cracks another beer.

T.S. Our research suggests the Annunaki

may have infiltrated our schools.

ARTHUR

(off Mr. Flores)

Noah, is he...?

Claire hugs Mr. Flores before driving off with Sam.

NOAH

That’s what I wanna know. Beer me.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT - NIGHT

Susan lies with her head in T.S.’s lap. Noah reads a book.

T.S. How’s the dextroamphetamine

treating you?

NOAH

Excellent! And microdosing with LSD

was a great idea. Hey, listen to

this: “A solar vortex will align

the frequencies of Earth with its

higher dimensional counterparts.”

SUSAN

I need to sleep.

Noah gets up to check the refrigerator: empty.

NOAH

So, the solar storms act like fiber

optic cable between worlds? A

bridge of some kind?

SUSAN

Hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...

T.S. Yes, but the Annunaki would need to

concentrate the protons somehow.

SUSAN

Hhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...
Page 61 of 97
Page 62 of 97

60.

T.S. Susan! Take a warm shower, do your

vinyasas, and sleep in my room. There’s Valium in the night stand.

NOAH

(checking his wallet)

Shit. I’m nearly broke.

T.S. I think its time we killed some

birds with some stones.

EXT. SUSAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

TWANG! A guy wire from the cell tower shoots by Noah! T.S. holds massive bolt cutters.

T.S. In the early 80’s, the Air Force

determined that very low frequency

electromagnetic signals could cause

depression, insomnia, migraines...

T.S. clamps down on the next guy wire.

NOAH

Population control?

T.S. Exactly. Step back again. I assumed

Susan was being melodramatic until

you heard it the other night, too.

TWANG! The next wire whips loose! A warbling, METALLIC GROAN

rolls from the tower. Noah reaches for the bolt cutters.

NOAH

May I?

T.S. Be careful. Each of these bad boys

contains about 145,000 PSI. I’d

estimate we have at least two or

three more to go before...

Noah cuts a new wire: TWANG! T.S. drops as it nearly beheads

him and knocks out a section of chain link fence instead. The

tower wobbles on its base. BEAMS BEND AND SHRIEK.

NOAH

Ah, fuck.
Page 62 of 97
Page 63 of 97

61.

T.S. Run. Run!

Noah and T.S. leap to safety as the tower COLLAPSES TO THE

GROUND! Dust clears. They brush themselves off, standing

before the fallen tower. Noah seems in shock, but:

NOAH

Wooooo! That was amazing! Susan’s

gonna sleep tonight!

(beat)

But we should get out of here.

T.S. Her nearest neighbor is over a mile

away. So let us honor our kill. Use

every part of the animal. Remember, scrap copper averages $2.10/lb.

INT. T.S.’ NEW TRUCK – METATRONIX HQ - DUSK

T.S. peers through binoculars while Noah fidgets, teeth

clacking. A knock on the cab’s window. Noah and T.S. jump.

JOHNNY

Party party.

T.S. Operation Tiger’s Eye isn’t a

party, Johnny.

Johnny gets in with a shopping bag. Noah removes a handle of

whiskey and a bag of coke. He cuts lines on a trapper keeper.

JOHNNY

(disappointed)

Test 9 was pretty fun.

NOAH

Let’s call 32 a bust and re-try 14.

T.S. I’m going to label this 32B since

you undoubtedly have traces of 32

still in your system.

NOAH

Fine.

T.S. takes notes on his legal pad:
Page 63 of 97
Page 64 of 97

62.

T.S. “Rivea corymbosa plus marijuana ...Old Crow and... whatever shitty

coke Johnny scrounged up.”

JOHNNY

You try finding decent yayo when

half the phones don’t work.

All three begin to alternately blow lines and chug whiskey.

C. Clarence Kyle, The Phoenix Seven, and Marco Flores exit

the building, shoulder to shoulder. Kyle gets in his car.

NOAH

Follow him.

INT. T.S.’ NEW TRUCK – STREETS - NIGHT

Noah, T.S., and Johnny drive behind Kyle’s gold Jaguar. The

semi-dense traffic of strip malls and gas stations gives way

to abandoned buildings at the edge of desert.

Kyle pulls into an empty lot where a SMALL DARK FIGURE

approaches, talks in the driver’s side window, then gets in.

JOHNNY

Did he...?

Kyle’s car drives away and T.S. follows. Noah, increasingly

manic, takes quick swigs from the whiskey jug.

NOAH

This asshole has his hand in

everything. Fucking prick.

T.S. He’s gotta be Annunaki, right?

Power player like this? You don’t

just climb the ranks...

Noah squints, but can’t see into Kyle’s tinted windows.

NOAH

(doing another line)

Let’s find out.

EXT. THE ORION MOTEL – NIGHT

T.S. tails from a distance as Kyle drives into THE ORION’s

parking lot and turns a corner behind the first building.
Page 64 of 97
Page 65 of 97

63.

T.S. (V.O.)

Is he here?

NOAH (V.O.)

Did you lose him?

The truck turns a corner just in time to see A MOTEL DOOR

CLOSING in front of the gold Jaguar.

EXT. THE ORION MOTEL – NIGHT

The truck is parked behind a dumpster. Noah, T.S., and Johnny

creep towards the motel room window. Noah whispers to T.S.:

NOAH

Give me the keys. I want to get the

camera. Let’s nail this fucker.

T.S. hands Noah the keys. Noah stumbles as the WORLD AROUND

HIM BEGINS TO SHIMMER AND MELT. He picks himself back up, opens the truck, reaches in, and comes back with a camera.

JOHNNY

What are we doing???

T.S. For years I’ve been tracking these

guys. If we can get proof of what

just one of them is up to...

Noah creeps toward Kyle’s room. His HAND MERGES WITH THE

CONCRETE, but he dislodges it. The lights flicker and dim.

From the room: SHRIEKING SOUNDS, like lobsters boiled alive

NOAH

(mouthing silently)

I - can - hear - them!

Noah raises himself to eye-level with the window, but the

blinds are closed and all he sees is the hint of movement.

NOAH

(mouthing silently)

Goddammit...

The ALIEN NOISES INTENSIFY, then cease. Noah crawls back.

JOHNNY

We need to get out of here.

T.S. Did you see anything?
Page 65 of 97
Page 66 of 97

64.

NOAH

No. They pulled the blinds.

The door to the motel room opens. Noah, T.S., and Johnny duck

behind the car again, then run for the truck. Noah gets in

the driver’s seat. The Jaguar drives away.

NOAH

Get in! We’re going to lose him!

Johnny and T.S. get in. Noah peels out after the Jaguar.

T.S. You okay to drive, man?

NOAH

Buckle up.

INT. T.S.’ NEW TRUCK – NIGHT

The gold Jaguar pulls onto 17-N. Noah accelerates.

T.S. Easy there...

Johnny plants his face into another line on the trapper

keeper and nearly falls over when Noah pulls a hard, wide

right onto the highway in pursuit. They gain on the Jaguar.

T.S. What, uh, whatcha doing, buddy?

NOAH

You trust me?

T.S. Of course, but 32B isn’t designed

for high speed –-

Noah shifts lanes to pass the Jaguar.

T.S. -- car chases.

Noah looks in his rear view mirror at the Jaguar.

NOAH

Good. We’re not chasing them.

Noah hits the brakes and --

JOHNNY

Jesus Christ!

T.S. Fuck!
Page 66 of 97
Page 67 of 97

65.

-- the JAGUAR SLAMS INTO THEM from behind. Noah throws open

the driver’s side door and steps onto the --

HIGHWAY: Noah strides over to find Kyle gripping his broken

nose. Beside Kyle, in the passenger seat, is a terrified, HANDSOME YOUNG TEENAGE BOY (15, tank top).

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Wha...?

JOHNNY

Oh shit...

Noah snaps a picture inside the Jaguar. KYLE CHANGES INTO AN

ANNUNAKI, then changes back, flickering like a broken TV set.

NOAH

I know what you are, Kyle!

(taking more pictures)

You think you’d be able to get away

with this? We’re on to you! You

like balls, Kyle? You want to see

my balls, you cocksucker?

C. CLARENCE KYLE

You wrecked my...what do you want?

NOAH

We’re going to expose you! You and

your friends! We know your secrets!

I know what you are! I can see you!

I don’t want anything from...

T.S. steps in and places his hand on Noah’s shoulder.

T.S. $10,000 each month. In perpetuity.

NOAH

No, I...

T.S. $10,000 each month. No negotiating.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Fuck you! Do you know who I am?

T.S. We do. And we have the pictures to

prove it. Pictures of...this. Pictures at the motel. That’s why

you’re going to stop pretending you

don’t know what’s happening here.
Page 67 of 97
Page 68 of 97

66.

Kyle looks at his bloodied shirt, at the boy, then at T.S.

T.S. You’ll hear from us with further

instructions. And then you’ll never

hear from us again. Your friends,

your family, humanity itself, won’t

have to know what we know. (to the boy)

Get out of the car. Look both ways

and get out of here.

The boy hesitates before fleeing across the highway.

NOAH

(still manic)

You think you can just treat people

like that? Like they’re nothing?

T.S. holds his gaze until Kyle sinks in resignation.

T.S. Do we have an understanding?

(off passing traffic)

Someone is going to call in this

accident you caused pretty soon.

Kyle nods. He is man. He is Annunaki.

T.S. Good. We’ll be in touch.

Johnny and T.S. head back to the truck. Noah leans into the

window at Kyle, whose reptilian eyes fill with rage.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

I will wipe you from this earth. Everything you have ever loved, every person, every creature, will

burn in a sea of flame.

Noah pauses, considering. He leans closer.

NOAH

I am the darkness you created.

Kyle begins crying quietly, just an old man in a car crash.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT – DAY

White table cloths. Candle light.
Page 68 of 97
Page 69 of 97

67.

Noah sits alone, wearing an ill-fitting suit. Even clean and

well dressed there is something not right about him.

Claire enters the restaurant, sees Noah, and approaches the

table. He stands, smiling. They hug awkwardly.

NOAH

Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

CLAIRE

You were pretty insistent. This

place is fancy.

NOAH

I’m sorry you couldn’t do dinner. They have a really nice tasting

menu. Lunch is good, though.

CLAIRE

Yeah, I’m sorry about that. I just

have, you know, stuff going on.

They’re still standing. Noah jumps to pull out her chair.

NOAH

Please! Sit.

They sit. Claire looks startled when a tuxedoed waiter begins

preparing a Caesar salad table side.

NOAH

I know you’re busy. And I hope you

don’t mind, but I ordered for us.

LATER: Noah tears open the back of a huge lobster. Claire has

barely touched hers. A bottle of champagne sits on ice.

CLAIRE

So, the historian...his book is

going to be published?

NOAH

I believe so. We’re making real

progress. And since I came on, we

got additional grants and T.S. gave

me a raise, so yeah.

CLAIRE

That’s good to hear. I’m glad

you’ve found something that makes

you happy. T.S...? Have I read

anything else by him?
Page 69 of 97
Page 70 of 97

68.

NOAH

T.S. Lopsia. No, this is his first

big book. Really interesting stuff.

CLAIRE

I guess I still don’t really

understand what it’s about.

NOAH

It’s about government. It’s about

religion. How the two are

intertwined to control populations.

CLAIRE

That could be interesting. He got

grants for this?

NOAH

Private funding.

Noah drinks and refills his champagne.

NOAH

For instance, did you know that

GWEN towers operate –-

CLAIRE

GWEN towers?

NOAH -- Ground-Wave Emergency Network. The cover story is they were built

for cell phones, but the wave

lengths they operate on are in fact

discernible by the human mind.

CLAIRE

Uh huh...

NOAH

Point being: mind control is easier

to accomplish on populations

perpetually coated in artificial

electromagnetic waves. Which is

basically everybody, but they

target the people who threaten to

expose it.

CLAIRE

Jesus Christ, Noah. What the fuck

are you doing? You sound insane.

Noah slams his fist on the table.
Page 70 of 97
Page 71 of 97

69.

NOAH

Don’t say that! I’m sorry. This is

the first...important...thing I’ve

been a part of in a long time. I

know it sounds odd. I thought so

too at first. But the things I’ve

seen, and the things I’ve learned. You’re living in a dream, Claire.

CLAIRE

Oh, I’m in the dream world? You

know, I spoke with your father.

Noah stares at her.

CLAIRE

You never told him? You never said, “Hey, Dad, I’m out of work and

letting my girlfriend support me”?

What the fuck, Noah? Did you think

he wasn’t going to find out?

NOAH

I wanted to, you know, find a job

and then tell him I’d changed jobs.

CLAIRE

Well, he was pretty surprised to

hear about this research assistant

position of yours. Or whatever it

is: crazy mind control bullshit.

NOAH

Goddammit! I was just waiting a

little while longer! I knew he

wouldn’t approve so I wanted the

book to get published, and... Thanks, Claire, thanks a lot. He’s

not your father. You don’t have to

deal with the mess you created, now

do you?

CLAIRE

Fuck. You. I didn’t create this

mess, I just have to deal with it. (beat)

Do you think you can win me back

with lobsters and champagne? You

know I don’t care about that. I

wanted you to be happy and

productive, and for us to be happy.

NOAH

I’m not trying to win you back.
Page 71 of 97
Page 72 of 97

70.

Claire stops cold, the argument taking a new direction.

NOAH

Do you remember that guy when we

were growing up? He stood on the

corner with the big sign: THE

VATICAN HIDES PEDOPHILES. Remember?

Everyone laughed at him. What a

nutcase! Crazy fucker! For years he

stood there. That man had been

raped, and humiliated, and abused. By people he trusted. We trusted!

And we laughed at him. But

now...who laughs at him now?

(beat)

I simply wanted to have a nice meal

with you before –-

Noah’s eyes well up. Looking across the restaurant, behind

Claire, TWO ANNUNAKI STARE AT HIM from a nearby table.

NOAH -- Before my schedule gets too

overwhelming. I’ve been working

really hard recently. Maybe I was

trying to impress you a little, you

know? I fucked up so badly with the

bills and my behavior. I want to

apologize but, no, I don’t want to

win you back. It’s only going to

get worse for me. The world is a

dark place.

CLAIRE

What are you talking about?

Noah closes his eyes.

NOAH

It’s almost there in the back of my

mind, but I don’t know what it is. It’s like a dream I haven’t had

yet. I’d never do anything to put

you in danger, you know that right?

CLAIRE

Noah...

NOAH

After today, you need to stay away

from me. I’m bad news. It’ll all

make sense when we’re done, but I

don’t know yet when that will be.
Page 72 of 97
Page 73 of 97

71.

Noah stands and pulls three $100 bills from his wallet.

NOAH

This should cover everything, including the tip. And this --

He hands her a paper envelope, folded in half.

NOAH -- should take care of my expenses

while I was unemployed. Bills. Groceries. Thank you. I wish I

could explain how grateful I am.

Noah crouches next to Claire.

NOAH

I love you. And I hope when we see

each other again, you finally

understand that.

He kisses her forehead, walks away. Claire stifles her tears.

INT. T.S.’ APARTMENT – NIGHT

LIVING ROOM: A single light illuminates Noah. He scribbles

notes on a pad of paper next to a dusty mirror.

HEADLIGHTS sweep across the room. He looks up, makes tea.

A CAR DOOR SLAMS. He stands still, listening. Nothing.

A SHADOW passes the window. He throws open the door! Nothing.

BEDROOM: T.S. sleeps. Noah sits on the floor with a cup of

tea and plays with the label: SWEET DREAMZ. [Claire’s brand]

NOAH

You awake? I want your input.

T.S. opens his eyes.

NOAH

When I have an idea, a synapse

fires, you know? But if space and

time are relative then how is that

any different from geomagnetic

storms crossing the solar system?

These storms are like ideas, they...hold on, I had it.

Noah checks his notes:
Page 73 of 97
Page 74 of 97

72.

NOAH

Wait, it’s in my notebook. In --

T.S. groans and rolls over. A SOFT SCRAPING NOISE is heard.

T.S. -- In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a

stately pleasure-dome decree.

NOAH

No, really, I think you’ll...

A CRASH from the living room. Noah runs to the --

LIVING ROOM: FIRE EVERYWHERE. As Noah enters, the flames

change from ORANGE to GREEN. Through them, he sees an

ARSONIST ANNUNAKI in the doorway, staring.

ARSONIST ANNUNAKI

Everything you ever loved will burn

in a sea of flame.

MORE ANNUNAKI run past outside! Noah steps into the burning

room, shielding his face, but T.S. drags him back to the --

BEDROOM: T.S. tries to unlatch a rear window.

T.S. They found us and we got nothing to

fight ‘em with! Fuck!

The window shatters! A GREEN FIREBALL flies past T.S.’ head

and crashes onto the bed. Fire blocks both exits! T.S. beats

at the flames. Noah sees a HATCH in the ceiling.

CRAWL SPACE: The hatch pops open. Noah climbs up, then pulls

T.S. with him. Smoke pours in. They crawl, choking, over

insulation until they CRASH through the ceiling into --

INT. NEIGHBORING APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

-- and fall in a heap of plaster on the floor. A MAN IN HIS

UNDERWEAR opens the bedroom door, yells, then picks up A BAT.

EXT. T.S.’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Noah and T.S. run from the neighbor’s apartment. The Annunaki

see them and, roaring in anger, chase them down a stairway!
Page 74 of 97
Page 75 of 97

73.

EXT. DOWNTOWN PHOENIX - NIGHT

Noah and T.S. sprint down abandoned streets, Annunaki close

behind! They round a corner, then hide in an --

ALLEY: Behind a dumpster. An Annunaki creeps by but does not

see them. They wait there, in the shadows, out of breath.

T.S. (PRELAP)

You’re doing the right thing. It’s

too dangerous right now.

INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE – MORNING

Noah sits, head in hands. T.S. has his arm around Noah. They

are covered in dust and soot. Susan makes coffee.

NOAH

(exhaling a bong hit)

I know. I know.

T.S. And we’re getting so close. I’m so

proud of you, everyone is. But my

apartment is destroyed. Our

research is burned to ash. We’ve

gone through 92 trials and nothing

has given us substantive results.

NOAH

I’m so sorry. I’m trying.

T.S. No, don’t apologize. We can’t

Konami code life, right? We need to

pull deeper, adjust for the truly

spiritual.

NOAH

I’m having trouble...you don’t know

where my thoughts go.

EXT. NORTHERN ARIZONA FOREST - DIRT ROAD – DAY

T.S. (V.O.)

I want you to come on a trip.

Dust kicks up as T.S.’ truck leads an old Toyota to --
Page 75 of 97
Page 76 of 97

74.

EXT. LOPSIA COMPOUND – DAY

-- what looks like a GHOST TOWN surrounded by pine trees.

Maia, who we recognize from Taco Bel, approaches the cars as

they park. T.S. walks toward Maia while the others get out.

T.S. Hello Maia.

MAIA

Hello my son.

INT. LOPSIA COMPOUND – DAY

Hand hewn. Ascetic. Noah, T.S., Susan, Arthur, and Johnny sit

at a table before a crackling fireplace. Maia smiles at Noah.

MAIA

I hear you’ve been quite the

trooper. Has T.S. been putting you

through the ringer?

NOAH

Uh, yeah, you could say that.

MAIA

From the very start, he was so

certain of you.

T.S.

“There are only two mistakes one

can make along the road to truth;

not starting --”

NOAH “-- and not going all the way.”

Maia smiles, placing her hands on their shoulders: her boys.

MAIA

I’m glad you’re getting along. I

would offer you something to eat, but you’ll want an empty stomach. It makes the travel easier.

JOHNNY

Where are we going exactly?

MAIA

(smiling at Johnny)

Have you ever been to a vortex?
Page 76 of 97
Page 77 of 97

75.

EXT. TRAIL – SUNSET

The group follows Maia through the forest past a waterfall.

T.S. Below us is one of the largest

quartz deposits on Earth. It

creates geomagnetic activity that

affects us on a cellular level.

MAIA

Now, Sedona tells tourists they

have the best vortexes, but we

chose this place for a reason.

They top a ridge and walk onto a MESA above the forest. In

the middle of it stands an ENORMOUS CIRCULAR STRUCTURE.

NOAH

What is that?

T.S. The Integratron. My father finished

it when I was still a kid.

SUSAN

Yeah, but what is it?

INT. INTEGRATRON – NIGHT

The group enters a round wooden room with a FLOWER OF LIFE

PATTERN inlaid in the floor and AUDIO SPEAKERS on the walls.

T.S. wanders through this space with reverence and awe.

T.S. Like Noah, my father could, on

occasion, see the Annunaki. But he

could hear them clearly.

MAIA

They’re not all bad, you know. They

instructed him to build this.

T.S. It channels the Earth’s energy to

awaken senses we’ve lost.

MAIA

Just as the telescope and

microscope revealed invisible

worlds, so too would The

Integratron
Page 77 of 97
Page 78 of 97

76.

NOAH

Are we going to meet your father?

T.S. turns away, runs his fingers over wood grain.

T.S. After he built it, he went in to

town for supplies. He was arrested

for drunk and disorderly --

MAIA

George didn’t drink.

T.S. -- And according to the reports, he

hung himself in his cell.

NOAH

I’m so...

MAIA

Federal Agents stole his papers, and removed all the copper wiring.

Maia points to broken brackets running up the walls.

JOHNNY

Fuck...

T.S. We don’t really know how it was

supposed to work.

ARTHUR

So why bring us here?

T.S. It still has power, somehow. I’ve

been so close...But you can’t just

come here and expect it to work. You have to be ready.

SUSAN

The tests...

NOAH

You’ve been preparing us.

T.S. nods, almost shy. Maia flips a switch and everything

subtly vibrates as ISOCHRONIC TONES pulse from the speakers.
Page 78 of 97
Page 79 of 97

77.

MAIA

If everyone could lie down, feet

towards the center, we can begin. Noah, remain standing for a sec.

Noah makes eye contact with Susan, who smiles and shrugs.

MAIA

Arthur? Can you scooch a little?

Try to align yourself directly

across from the other person.

T.S. Noah, can you lay at the top?

Noah takes his place. Maia hands him a wooden cup.

NOAH

What’s this?

MAIA

Mostly Greenthread and Honeysuckle. Good for the kidneys. (beat)

Some Jimson Weed. And a little

Dimethyltriptamine. Shanthi.

NOAH

Ok.

MAIA

(so only Noah can hear)

I hear wonderful things about you.

Noah drinks from the cup and passes it to Johnny. Maia

circles the group and speaks loudly:

MAIA

Tonight your struggle becomes our

struggle. Please drink from the cup

and clear your minds.

T.S. Shanthi. Shanthi. Shanthi.

MAIA (PRELAP)

May the wrath of the god who is

unknown to me be pacified! I sought

for help but no one took my hand! I

wept but no one came to my side!

Noah sees the ceiling BREAK DOWN IN GEOMETRIC PATTERNS.
Page 79 of 97
Page 80 of 97

78.

ALL

Shanthi. Shanthi. Shanthi.

MAIA (PRELAP)

I am lamented, but no one hearkens

to me! I am afflicted, I am

overcome! How long, my god, until

thy face be turned toward me?

ALL

Shanthi. Shanthi. Shanthi.

The Integratron dissolves around Noah as he ascends into --

MAIA (V.O.)

Mankind is perverted and has no

judgment. Of all men alive, who

truly knows anything? They do not

know whether they do good or evil.

NIGHT SKY: Constellations cycle through the Zodiac. The stars

grow brighter until Noah has to squeeze his eyes shut. Noah

opens his eyes and finds himself in a --

WHITE HALLWAY: at the end of which are two large old wooden

doors. He pushes them open --

INT. CAVE OF BEL EA - FRONT CHAMBER - NIGHT

-- and enters a rectangular chamber of white marble floors in

a perfect grid, the coffered ceiling mimicking the floor: one

coffer per seven tiles, seven times.

At the far end stands BEL EA, an elderly Annunaki.

BEL EA (O.S.)

You’re going to have to come

closer. I’m afraid I can barely see

you over there.

Noah comes closer. Bel Ea looks down at Noah with milky eyes.

BEL EA

Your name is Noah Evemeras.

NOAH

Your name is Bel Ea. My god...

BEL EA

You used to worship me.

NOAH

But we can’t see you anymore.
Page 80 of 97
Page 81 of 97

79.

BEL EA

Yet here you are. With your gifts, your skills, you can make things

right, Noah.

NOAH

What good are my gifts to a world

that can’t appreciate them?

Around them, A HOLOGRAM OF SHIFTING PLATONIC SOLIDS appears.

BEL EA

I am going to tell you a story:

When we came here, there was

nothing. Endless seas and rocky

mountains. We brought life to the

seas, life to the land. And when we

attached a bit of our DNA to a

struggling primate, we created you.

The HOLOGRAM SHIFTS AGAIN, through the small patterns Noah

has seen, like soap suds, ice crystals, flocks of birds --

BEL EA

This world is a place of order and

beauty. That is because we made it

so. Patterns, visible even in

chaos, demonstrate our love. You

see that, Noah. (beat)

We are world builders. And you

worshipped us for it.

-- and GROWING LARGER until they become population patterns, fractals, complex geometries.

NOAH

And now that we don’t...

The hologram turns into THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

BEL EA

Man is part of the pattern and must

know his place. (beat)

Many years ago I gave the throne to

my son, Marduk. Marduk believes he

failed me. He believes he failed

you. He wants to start over. I

cannot blame him.

NOAH

He’s building a light bridge.
Page 81 of 97
Page 82 of 97

80.

Bel Ea pauses at this. On the hologram, A BEAM OF LIGHT

stretches from the SUN to EARTH.

BEL EA

But you, Noah, you can see us once

more. Perhaps there is hope.

NOAH

You didn’t make Man because we

needed you. You made Man because

you needed us. (beat)

My gifts, my skills... Did you

create me just to subjugate me?

BEL EA

Subjugation is the absolute truth

of your existence. It is your place

in the pattern. You are lost

without it. (beat)

Do you love your family?

NOAH

Yes, of course...

BEL EA

You want to care for them?

NOAH

Yes...

BEL EA

Make them smile? Help them when

they get sick?

Noah nods.

BEL EA

We can offer you that. Wealth. Happiness. Safety. Whatever you

want. We can get it for you. (beat)

All you have to do is admit to

yourself what you are and SHOW THE

WORLD HOW TO KNEEL!

NOAH

And if I don’t? If we don’t?

A FLOWER OF LIFE ERUPTS IN FLAME on the Earth-hologram, spreading across the surface.

The ROOM STARTS DISSOLVING as the world burns before them.
Page 82 of 97
Page 83 of 97

81.

BEL EA

A thousand Burning Hydras, bright

as the sun, will cross the bridge. They will consume you all.

Noah meets Bel Ea’s gaze, unblinking. Bel Ea approaches.

NOAH

I hold my head high.

BEL EA

WE ARE WORLD BUILDERS! YOU ARE --

EXT. DESERT – MORNING

Noah - skin red, lips cracked - stands shakily. He stumbles

over rocks until he reaches the grassy mesa, passing The

Integratron as he follows the sound of distant water.

EXT. WATERFALL – DAY

T.S., Susan, Johnny, Arthur, and Maia skinny dip under the

falls. They spot Noah and cheer. He kneels at the bank and

takes a sip in his cupped hand. He takes off his clothes --

MAIA

We knew you’d find your way back.

ARTHUR

I woke up in a tree.

-- and slips under water. He stays there while the others

swim to greet him. He raises only his eyes above the surface, watches sunlight play across it in patterns only he can see.

NOAH

I’m going to tell you a story.

The group draws in tighter.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – DAY

Claire, Alice, and Jim walk into the auditorium.

ALICE

Thanks for doing this. I know Sam

appreciates it.

CLAIRE

Of course. I love Sam.
Page 83 of 97
Page 84 of 97

82.

ALICE

Have you gotten through to “him”?

CLAIRE

No, he’s not answering his phone.

JIM

We’re real sorry about everything.

Mr. Flores smiles warmly at Claire from across the room. The

female PRINCIPAL (60’s, short hair) tugs on his arm.

PRINCIPAL

Just leave the chairs out after the

show. We need them for tomorrow.

LATER: The lights dim and Mr. Flores takes the stage.

MR. FLORES

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for

coming to the Rock Choir

Spectacular! The kids have been

practicing non-stop. Those of you

who will be attending tomorrow’s

ribbon cutting, we apologize but

parking will be limited. Now on

with the show!

A young girl takes the stage as the band plays the first

notes of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees”:

YOUNG GIRL “The fake plastic watering can...”

INT. T.S.’ TRUCK - LOPSIA COMPOUND – DAY

Maia leans into the driver’s side window. T.S. stretches

across Noah and kisses his mother on the cheek.

NOAH

Thank you, Maia, for everything.

She hands him a thermos.

MAIA

Some tea. For your journey. How

long until...until I know?

NOAH

Soon. 24 hours, give or take. If

T.S. Hadn’t found me when he did...
Page 84 of 97
Page 85 of 97

83.

She nods and backs away. Noah drives down the dirt road, followed by the other car.

EXT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE – PARKING LOT - DAY

The caravan parks below a brightly lit neon sign.

INT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - SHOP – DAY

The group enters, greeted by WALLACE (50’s, shaved head).

ARTHUR

Wallace, how are you?

WALLACE

SSDD, you know.

NOAH

Not today.

EXT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - PARKING LOT - DAY

The neon sign goes dark.

INT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - BACK ROOM

The group follows Wallace through a narrow doorway.

WALLACE

Frankly, I don’t care what that

two-bit Kenyan has to say. There’s

no ambiguity in “Shall not be

infringed.” Arthur vouches for you. That’s all I care about.

Wallace opens a cabinet lined with SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

WALLACE

Will this do?

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – DAY

A GROUP OF CHILDREN sings the final choir to “Float On” by

Modest Mouse. Claire, Alice, and Jim clap with the crowd.

CLAIRE

Where’s Sam?
Page 85 of 97
Page 86 of 97

84.

Alice shakes her head, baffled. The children come back out on

stage and bow. The crowd breaks into louder applause.

Sam walks out and takes his place in front of the stage. The

band begins to play “Lord Anthony” by Belle and Sebastian.

SAM (PRELAP) “Anthony, bullied at school...”

INT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - OUTDOOR RANGE – DAY

Sam’s voice is all we hear as Noah et al. shoot at targets, gun barrels exploding brightly in slow motion.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – DAY

Alice grabs Claire’s hand and looks like she’s about to cry.

EXT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - OUTDOOR RANGE – DAY

Noah and T.S. chug beers and shoot at cans. Johnny tries to

look tough, shooting his handgun with a side grip. Susan

destroys a full body target with A LIZARD FACE DRAWN ON IT.

EXT. CRACK SHOT SHOOTING RANGE - PARKING LOT – DAY

Noah throws a tarp over STACKED WEAPONS in the truck bed.

EXT. SUSAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

T.S.’ truck and the old Toyota out front. Caution tape

surrounds the destroyed cell tower.

INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Partying hard: wine, beer, vodka, bong hits, coke. Noah

dances with Susan. Johnny jumps on the couch, pretending to

shoot at them. T.S. crushes pills.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – DAY

All the children behind Sam break into the chorus:

CHOIR ”Anthony it could be worse...”

The crowd responds with happy laughter. Sam smiles shyly.
Page 86 of 97
Page 87 of 97

85.

SAM “You’ll soon be old enough to leave

them. Without a notion of a care.”

INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE – NIGHT

Susan sleeps upright on the couch. Johnny wrestles Arthur.

Noah falls against a wall, collapses on the floor.

T.S., already on the floor, sees Noah fall. He tries to get

up, but can barely move. He rolls onto his stomach and crawls

over bottles, garbage, and cigarette butts toward Noah.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – DAY

Sam finishes his song, raising one hand above his head in a

peace sign. The other children follow suit.

SAM “You’ll leave two fingers in the

air. To linger there.”

Alice, Jim and Claire leap to their feet, clapping wildly

with the crowd. Claire locks eyes with Mr. Flores. Alice

looks at Noah’s empty seat. Sam can’t hide his grin.

INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE – NIGHT

All is quiet after Sam’s song.

T.S. finally reaches Noah, who is unconscious yet his eyes

are slightly open. With great effort, T.S. picks Noah’s head

off the floor and uses himself as a pillow while Noah sleeps.

T.S. strokes his hair and stares down at him, whispering:

T.S. You’re going to save the world.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. SUSAN’S HOUSE – MORNING

Soft morning darkness. A BEAM OF SUNLIGHT breaks through a

crack in the curtain and lands on Noah’s face. Noah wakes

with a start. Noah taps him. T.S. groans.

NOAH

Shh... It’s time to go.
Page 87 of 97
Page 88 of 97

86.

T.S. sits up.

T.S. But what about...?

NOAH

Just you and me.

EXT. CAMELBACK MOUNTAIN – MORNING

The sky is a brilliant pink. Noah and T.S. sit at the peak, watching over the city.

NOAH

I want to thank you. For pushing

me, and trusting me.

T.S. I’ve learned more from you than

anyone else. My father tried to

show me, but I was too young. I

wish I could do what he did, what

you do. I try and try but I can’t.

Noah puts his hand on T.S.’ back, now the one to comfort him.

NOAH

You’re better than that. You’re

strong enough to have faith.

T.S. No one will believe us. I’ve been

doing this a long time and trust

me, no one will ever believe us.

Noah pulls the thermos Maia gave him from his backpack.

NOAH

What the caterpillar calls the end

of the world, we call a butterfly.

Noah pours from the thermos into the cup-lid. He raises it

with both hands toward the rising sun, then takes a small

sip. He gives the cup to T.S., who also takes a sip.

T.S. (almost to himself)

Shanthi...shanthi...

PLANES CARVE CONTRAILS INTO THE SKY, first one, then two

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - HALLWAY – MORNING

Marco Flores and Kyle walk, followed by the Phoenix Seven.

Kyle has just the hint of a bruise beneath his eyes.

MARCO

They did baseline tests yesterday. Without question, this place will

be generating more power than it

needs. You’ll have a favorable ROI

within three years. (gesturing to the others)

All of you will.

They enter --

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM – MORNING

A large banner reads: CLEAN SOLAR POWER FOR OUR CHILDREN. FOR

OUR FUTURE! Below it is an oversized cardboard power switch.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

(hissing to Marco)

We did the numbers. I know. But

that means it has to work. That

depends on your people. Even if I

keel over dead tomorrow, I can make

sure you never get re-elected.

MARCO

I hope we can test that hypothesis.

The Principal greets them, Javier Jackson (17, we last saw

him holding hands with Maria) beside her.

PRINCIPAL

Well, isn’t today exciting? A

victory for the environment!

(off Javier)

And this is our student body

president, Javier Jackson. He’ll be

introducing you this morning.

JAVIER

It’s a pleasure to meet you.

MARCO

The pleasure’s all mine, Javier. I

ran for student body president, myself. “When You Vote Flores, Every Day is Taco Tuesday.” I

didn’t win that time.

They both laugh. Javier sticks his hand out for Kyle. Kyle

nods uncomfortably, dodges the handshake, touches his bruise.

EXT. ROAD - SAME

T.S.’ truck drives down empty road. The contrail grid

remains. METAL SMOKESTACKS PUMP GREEN CLOUDS into the sky.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM - SAME

Children pour in. The Phoenix Seven sit on stage with Marco

Flores. Maria sits with friends. Caleb sticks out his tongue

at Sam, who talks to some girls. The Principal takes the mic:

PRINCIPAL

Settle down, you little rascals. Ok. Who’s psyched? I know I am!

Today is the result of years of

hard work...

INT. T.S.’ TRUCK - SAME

Noah, driving, passes a bowl to T.S. With the windows down, Noah lets the wind catch his hand and drop it.

A RAVEN crashes on his windshield, then another. THOUSANDS OF

BIRDS FALL FROM THE SKY. Noah steps on the gas.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM - SAME

A round of applause. Javier is now on stage.

JAVIER

It is fitting that so many

ancestors of the Aztec people are

here today to see the era of

Tonatiuh, the sun god, continue

peacefully. And without human

sacrifice.

Laughter. A girl passes a note to Sam, who blushes.

JAVIER

Without further ado, I’d like to

ask a man who has sacrificed both

time and money to make this all

possible: Mr. C. Clarence Kyle!

Kyle waves gamely to the crowd.

JAVIER

Mr. Kyle has been an active civic

leader in the Valley for over 50

years. It is safe to say that

without the vision and generosity

of the Kyle family, this city

wouldn’t be what it is today. Mr. Kyle, would you be so kind as to

throw the switch, and start a new

era of eco-friendly energy at Barry

Goldwater K-12!

Kyle walks to the oversized cardboard switch and pauses

dramatically. Marco signals a worker in the back of the room.

C. CLARENCE KYLE

Let there be light!

Kyle pulls the switch. The lights go out.

EXT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - SAME

Noah and T.S. stand at the entrance when the thousands of new

SOLAR PANELS COME TO LIFE, aligning to reflect the sun.

NOAH

We’ve got to hurry.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - CURLE AUDITORIUM - SAME

The audience oohs and ahhs. And then, the electricity comes

back on and THE SWITCH IS BRIGHTLY LIT with blinking lights.

APPLAUSE DROWNS OUT THE SOUND OF DISTANT GUNFIRE. Only a few

heads turn. SCREAMS come from somewhere in the building.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - HALLWAY – SAME

THE ANNUNAKI SCREAMS an inhuman cry and goes down in a

horrific spray of GREEN GOO! Noah lowers his weapon.

An ANNUNAKI charges T.S.! He speaks quietly as he aims --

T.S. “Let me not then die ingloriously

and without a struggle, but let me

first do some great thing that

shall be told among men hereafter.”

-- and shoots the terrible creature with precision.

90.

Noah and T.S., armed with weapons from the day before, creep

stealthily down the hall. From around a corner comes an

ANNUNAKI GUARD, firing at them with a LASER CANNON. They duck

into a doorway and return fire.

The alien falls, clutching its chest, and tries to crawl

away, dragging THICK GREEN GOO behind it, but Noah stands

over it, shoots again, and puts it down.

They run and kick open the doors of --

CURLE AUDITORIUM – CONTINUOUS: which is crawling with

Annunaki and people in a confusing jumble. The stage, full of

Annunaki, GLOWS A GOLDEN HUE. Noah fires into the air.

NOAH

Everybody’s going to die if you

don’t pay attention to what I say!

Children scream and Annunaki hiss. An Annunaki rushes T.S. and wraps its scaly arms around his neck. Noah pulls out a

handgun and drops it with a SHOT TO THE HEAD, covering him

and T.S. in GREEN ALIEN VISCERA. The crowd cries in panic.

T.S. (breathing heavily)

Can you tell them apart?

NOAH

(quietly to T.S.)

I’ve never seen them so clearly. (now louder to everyone)

We’re not afraid of you. We know

what’s happening and we’re here to

put a stop to it. Who’s in charge?

Which one of you is Mar...

AN ANNUNAKI ON STAGE raises its clawed hand and steps

forward, bathed in golden light. Noah points his gun at it.

MARDUK

I am the one you’re looking for. Please, just...put the guns down.

TWO MORE ANNUNAKI GUARDS leap in through a fire exit. The

beams from their laser cannons fly over the crowd. T.S. returns fire, SHOOTING WILDLY. Noah runs, ducking and firing!

T.S. puts one of the guards down, and Noah heroically follows

suit. The crowd panics, surges. An Annunaki almost makes it

to the door but Noah shoots it in the back.
Page 92 of 97
Page 93 of 97

91.

T.S. You’re not in control anymore!

We’re not your slaves!

He shoots and kills THREE ANNUNAKI across the room. The

bodies of SLAIN ANNUNAKI WARRIORS - LARGE AND SMALL - are

scattered throughout the auditorium, slumped over seats.

Otherwise, the room is mostly empty.

Noah gestures to the Annunaki onstage.

NOAH

Everyone, off. Group up on the

floor here. Come on. (to Marduk)

Show the world how to kneel.

When the Annunaki leave the stage, the GLOW GROWS EVEN

BRIGHTER. Noah lines the Annunaki up on their knees.

A PORTAL opens in the floor of the stage.

NOAH

(to T.S., off the portal)

The light bridge...do you see it?

T.S. follows Noah’s eyeline.

T.S. Yes...Yes!

NOAH

(to Marduk)

It never had to come to this. Shut

it down.

MARDUK

It is an automated system. It will

take time. Try to see the big

picture.

NOAH

I see the patterns you don’t want

me to see. I see you for what you

really are. All of you.

Noah strides to where Kyle-Annunaki (NERGAL) kneels. We see

him clearly in Annunaki form for the first time.

NOAH

Don’t I, Nergal?
Page 93 of 97
Page 94 of 97

92.

T.S. The god of war --

NOAH

(reciting a flash card) -- and the Sun. In its destructive

capacity.

NERGAL

I should have killed you when I had

the chance.

MARDUK

He does not speak for me!

NOAH

(to Nergal)

You tried. You failed.

From the portal, A FIERY GREEN HYDRA WITH SEVEN HEADS pulls

itself out of the floor.

MARDUK

We are trying to make a better

world.

NOAH

A better world? For who?

MARDUK

For everyone!

T.S. lines his gun up and shoots the farthest Annunaki in

line. BANG! Marduk cringes, hissing.

NOAH

Everyone? But we’re not people to

you, are we? We’re...things to be

manipulated.

T.S. shoots again - BANG! - killing another. His gunfire

gives the conversation a rhythm.

MARDUK

Please...as a leader, I have to

make the tough decisions.

BANG! Noah stands over Marduk, puts the gun under his chin.

NOAH

Look at me. When was the last time

you looked at a Man, really looked

at him, and understood he’s alive?
Page 94 of 97
Page 95 of 97

93.

BANG! Marduk looks Noah in the eyes.

MARDUK

Please. Please try to understand. (beat)

Whatever you want. I can get it for

you.

BANG!

NOAH

Wealth. Happiness. Safety...

NERGAL

We can get it for you.

Noah lowers his weapon.

NOAH

All of this is predicated on your

immediate release.

Marduk and Nergal nod, relieved.

NOAH

Which we will not be doing.

BANG! Noah shoots Nergal between the eyes!

The glowing hydra still struggles out of the portal.

There is another loud BANG! Only this time --

T.S. Noah...

-- Blood spurts from T.S.’s chest. One of the injured

ANNUNAKI GUARDS has crawled from behind a chair and shot him.

Noah shoots the guard and runs to T.S., now on the ground.

NOAH

(crying)

I’m so sorry...

T.S. sputters through blood filling his mouth. He grips

Noah’s hand as his eyes lose focus.

T.S. -- ”If the world hates you, know

that it hated me first.”

Noah weeps as T.S. dies.
Page 95 of 97

94.

Marduk tries to escape. Noah shoots Marduk in the leg, sending him sprawling.

He tackles him, and they grapple on the floor. AN EPIC BRAWL.

Noah finally gets on top of Marduk and starts to choke him.

MARDUK

(gasping)

All I asked, was that you believed

in me.

NOAH

(astonished)

That’s all I’ve ever wanted.

He chokes Marduk even harder until Marduk finally dies. He

stares at him carefully for a second and the room is quiet, except for the sound of the BURNING HYDRA, now nearly free.

Noah stands and confidently fires at it.

The monster cries and writhes in pain. It loses its grip on

the portal and begins to sink back inside. Noah pulls a

grenade off his belt and tosses it at the beast.

He turns and walks out of the room as the beast explodes, the

lights go out, and the LIGHT BRIDGE CLOSES.

INT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - HALLWAY – SAME

Emergency lights illuminate the hallway.

Noah walks confidently - head up, shoulders back - COVERED IN

GREEN ALIEN GOO. The auditorium burns behind him. He passes

the corpses of defeated Annunaki.

He sees, through a window, the SAME SCENE we saw on PAGE ONE.

Police cars and fire trucks. Students and teachers running

from the burning building. A blonde newswoman speaking to

Maria. He can hear them talking about him:

MARIA

He saved me. He saved us.

He watches Maria rush, sobbing, to a Hispanic woman.

MARIA

Mama?
Page 96 of 97
Page 97 of 97

95.

MAMA

Mi bebé! Mi bebé! Me moriría si te

perdiera. Yo no sería nada.

Noah moves on. When he gets to the inner doors of the main

entrance, he places his gun calmly on the ground. He opens

the inner doors, STEPPING INTO SHADOW.

NEWSWOMAN (O.S.)

We have to remember this: In the

midst of tragedy there were heroes.

He pauses, almost smiling, slowing his breath.

EXT. BARRY GOLDWATER K-12 - MORNING

Maria, hugging her mother tight, turns back to the newswoman.

MARIA

It was Flores! Marco Flores saved

us! He...

She stops talking. All eyes turn as:

Noah opens the outer doors with his hands in the air, and

steps out of shadow into the LIGHT OF DAY.

The ALIEN GOO remains in the same spray patterns on his face

and chest, only now it is a BRIGHT AND VERY HUMAN RED.

A SWAT TEAM surrounds Noah, ordering him to the ground.

Noah sees Claire, and we are reminded of the time he watched

her in Alice’s kitchen, but now she sobs with one hand

clasped to her mouth while CALEB ALONE clings to her waist.

Noah speaks to her, and only her:

NOAH

I know who I am, baby. I know what

I can do.

The SWAT team tackles him to the ground. Pull up and away

past black smoke to a clear blue morning sky.

FADE OUT.
